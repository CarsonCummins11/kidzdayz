<div class="post_text">Lucy's science fair project was one of the ones chosen to represent her school in the Northwest Science Expo.  She got to miss the whole day of school on Friday and spend the day downtown at PSU doing activities around the science fair (both high school and middle school) and answer "a LOT" of questions from 5 different judges about their project.  Late in the afternoon parents were "allowed" to come view all the projects then stay for the awards ceremony.  It was such an honor and a very exciting day for Lucy!</div>
