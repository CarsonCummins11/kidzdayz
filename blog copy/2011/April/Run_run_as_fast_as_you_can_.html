<div class="post_text">Lucy decided to run track this spring.  Saturday was her first meet.  Talk about bringing back memories...  Track is REALLY hard!!  She ran the 1500meter and the 800meter.  She enjoyed the 1500 and really didn't enjoy the 800!  I was SO proud of her being out there and sticking with it.  She did a great job!!</div>
