<div class="post_text">We are supposed to be in Washington D.C. this week.  Our flight was scheduled to arrive at 5pm Saturday.  Unfortunately that's about the same time that Hurricane Irene was expected to arrive in D.C.  All flights into the city (and all surrounding areas) were cancelled.  I spent a full 9 hours on the phone with Expedia trying to figure this all out on Friday.  We've now re-booked our trip for November.  It was all quite an ordeal.  However... we've decided to make the best of it.  The weather is beautiful in Portland right now so we're going to really enjoy this last week of summer!  So today we went to the Portland Art Museum followed by a pic-nic at Washington Park.  It honestly couldn't have been more lovely :)</div>
