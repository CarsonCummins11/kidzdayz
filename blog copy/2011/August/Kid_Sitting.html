<div class="post_text">Ale has been here visiting for a few weeks and has been asking if I'd let him "kid-sit" (his words - probably trying not to offend) Lucy and Carson.  So, today I went to lunch with a friend and left him to it.  They played a few board games, made a very fancy lunch and were getting ready to swim when I got home.  Ale taught Carson to use the grill :)</div>
