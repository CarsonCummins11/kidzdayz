<div class="post_text">Carson is taking a summer camp/class right now which is being taught by his all-time favorite teacher - Miss Larsen.  It's turning out to be extremely cool.  They're doing "literature studies" (whatever that means for an almost 4th grader), math challenge games, and the big thing is a giant research project and presentation.  He's creating a virtual museum tour of a made-up museum showcasing Theodore Roosevelt.  The best part... he LOVES it!  After the 3rd day I was putting him to bed and he said "I can't wait to go to class tomorrow".  I think he would love anything Miss Larsen was teaching :)</div>
