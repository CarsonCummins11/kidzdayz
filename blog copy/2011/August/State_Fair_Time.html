<div class="post_text">Andy was honestly sad this year that we were going to be in DC during the Oregon State Fair.  So, as luck would have it, we ended up in town and Andy had a few days off.  This morning I took Lucy and some girlfriends shopping at the mall (no pictures of course - how embarrassing!!), and then we met up with Andy and Carson for an afternoon/evening at the fair.  We were there almost until closing time.  Grandma and Papa met us there and LOTS of fun was had by all!  Andy was not disappointed :)</div>
