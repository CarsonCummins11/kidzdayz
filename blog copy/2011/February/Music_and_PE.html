<div class="post_text">The third grade music and PE program was tonight.  Carson was less than enthusiastic about the music portion.  He's not entirely down with the selection of songs, moves, etc.  I had to give him the "stop goofing off with your buddies" glare several times...  However, the PE portion of the evening was right up his alley.  He got to ride his unicycle for everyone and loved it!  It was all very cute.</div>
