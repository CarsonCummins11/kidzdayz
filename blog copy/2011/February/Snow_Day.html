<div class="post_text">I'm guessing that anyone living within 5 miles of our house heard Carson when he woke up at 6:45 and screamed "SNOW DAY!!"  They slept with their PJ's inside-out and spoons under their pillows.  They didn't flush the ice cubes down the toilet because our ice maker is broken and I refused to go buy ice for that purpose ("fine, it will be your fault if there's school tomorrow")... and it worked!  It wasn't a lot of snow but it doesn't take a lot of snow here.</div>
