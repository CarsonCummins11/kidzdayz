<div class="post_text">Headed back up to the mountain on Sunday.  We cross-country skiied at a new place this time.  It's shocking how much snow melted over the past week of warm rains!  We had to stop several times and take off our skis and walk over bare patches.  The weather was very pleasant, though, and we all had a very good time.  No one more than Zoe of course.</div>
