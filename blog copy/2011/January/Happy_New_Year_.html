<div class="post_text">Spent the day up skiing with friends. It was beautiful and sunny at the mountain, but OH SO COLD!!  It was around 16 degrees and -6 with the windchill.  We took one run before having to go back to the lodge for more layers and hand warmers. Once we were properly appointed - had a GREAT time!</div>
