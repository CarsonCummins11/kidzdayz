<div class="post_text">The kids had the day off school on Friday so Andy took the day off work and we headed up to stay a night at Timberline Lodge.  We left right after school and luckily the weather cooperated.  We got up to the mountain, had dinner, played in the heated outdoor swimming pool and hot tub, then played in the game room.  It's such a great place to hang out - such a wonderful old ski lodge. </div>

<div class="post_text">On Friday we got up and skied the whole day.  The weather was great up until the last run or two when it really started snowing very wet snow.  Overall a really great adventure!</div>
