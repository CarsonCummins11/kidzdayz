<div class="post_text">On Saturday Andy and Lucy stayed in Terre Haute for the wedding rehearsal while Carson and I joined a bunch of family for a day on a pontoon boat at Racoon Lake.Â  Lucky for us, Aunt Nancy's sister, Cindy, and her family joined us with their speed boat and inner tubes as well as their 3 older sons who Carson LOVED hanging out with.</div>
