<div class="post_text">The week went super fast for all of us but I was sure excited to see my two kids get off the bus today!  They were full of all the great stories you'd expect after a week at camp.  Inclucing the fact that they performed a duet on the piano for the talent show!  I loved that one.  They're both dirty and exhausted but they can't stop telling us all the stories about the fantastic friends, counselors, games, sleep-outs, food, hiking, digging, shows, etc, etc.  I love their enthusiasm and am happy they're home!!</div>
