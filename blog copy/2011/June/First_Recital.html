<div class="post_text">The kids and I have been taking piano lessons for 5 weeks now and the first recital for our teacher was yesterday.  The kids went for it and played.  I opted out.  I can't seem to get the video to work on the blog so I'll just post pictures.  Carson played The Flintstones theme song and a very cool song that he made up himself followed by a duet with Lucy of Heart and Soul.  Then Lucy played Lean on Me and a song called Whirling Leaves.  They both did really great, especially given our relatively little experience!</div>
