<div class="post_text">Today I went on a field trip with Carson's class.  We did a walking tour of downtown Portland.  It was fascinating!  I loved it and learned a lot!  Funny, all the places I've walked right by without even looking.  This really is very interesting and unique city.  One little fact I loved was that city code requires that any building that is build downtown has to have 2% of the cost of building go to "public art".  That's why we have so much art everywhere downtown.</div>
