<div class="post_text">Lucy is currently in the school play.  She was thrilled to get a part and has worked very hard rehearsing since February.  She's a maid in a very funny show called Murder by Indecision.  Tonight was her first night and it was a great success!  She had a lot of friends/supporters there cheering her on.  What a great experience for her.  She's had a blast!  One more show on Wednesday night.</div>
