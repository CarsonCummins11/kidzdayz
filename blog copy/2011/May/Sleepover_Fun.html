<div class="post_text">We're not going anywhere for Memorial Day so the kids wanted to catch up on playing with friends.  Molly slept over on Saturday night with Lucy.  Lucy had a piano lesson while Molly was here so her instructor included Molly in the lesson.  Here Lucy and Molly are teaching Carson Heart and Soul :)</div>
