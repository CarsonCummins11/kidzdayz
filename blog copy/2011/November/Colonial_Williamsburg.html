<div class="post_text">After 4 days in DC we rented a car and headed down to Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia.  It was fantastic!  We especially loved all the re-enactments of the events leading up to the Revolutionary War.  We were so lucky with the weather!  We spent a day and a half walking around the historical town with all the people of the town dressed up in period ware.  We went into a wig makers shop, a silversmith, a milliner, a blacksmith, etc. in the town as well as a really cool plantation with people there explaining the history around it.  At night we went to a show called "Cry Witch" where we watched a real witch trial from the 1700's and then were part of the jury.  I (and about 5 others) voted innocent.  Everyone else voted guilty.  It was really fascinating.  The whole experience gave us such an education on history in a way we'd never really thought of it before.  It is well worth going to see!!</div>
