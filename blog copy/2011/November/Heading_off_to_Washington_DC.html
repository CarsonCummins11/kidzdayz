<div class="post_text">Our trip to DC which was supposed to happen in August but was cancelled due to Hurrican Irene, finally happened.  We just got back from a fantastic trip where we learned a lot and had a great time.  We were so lucky with weather and all our logistics!  There is definitely more to see but we did a pretty good job of covering most of the things we really wanted to see!</div>

<div class="post_text">Our new habit is to take MAX, the light rail, to the airport.  It's SO great!  Someone drops us off at the station near our house and just under an hour later we're let off right at the ticketing counters.  So convenient and cheap!  Plus never a problem with traffic!</div>
