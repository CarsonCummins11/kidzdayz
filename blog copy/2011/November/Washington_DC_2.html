<div class="post_text">Day 2 we had a tour of the Capitol Building including an entry into the Senate Gallery where we got to watch our Oregon Senator, Ron Wyden, speaking.  Then we went to Library of Congress, which was suprisingly great!  It was among my very favorite things we did in DC, and the Supreme Court.  After a late lunch/early dinner we stopped in the National Museum of American Portraiture.  We were suprised by how much we liked this one and would highly recommend it to anyone going.  It's off the beaten path but has a fantastic surprise in the center of the museum!</div>
