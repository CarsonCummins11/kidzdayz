<div class="post_text">Last week Andy was in Europe for work.  He was gone 8 days total.  He went to Munich, Deuseldorf, Vienna, Slovakia, Milan, Grenoble and Lyon.  5 countries and 7 cities all in really 6-7 days if you take out flying time.  He did get to see some cool places but all VERY briefly!  The big highlight for him was getting to go to an AC Milan professional soccer match!  That was really big!</div>
