<div class="post_text">Carson got "10 idles" - not entirely sure what that means - so his PE teacher let him borrow his personal unicycle which has a much larger wheel so he can go faster.  Carson says it's the step before getting a giraffe unicyle - one of the really tall ones.  He's very excited about it!</div>
