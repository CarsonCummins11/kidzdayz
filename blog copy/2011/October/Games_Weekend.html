<div class="post_text">It was a big weekend for games at our house.  Friday we finally got back into the swing of Friday Family Game Night.  Carson took home the trophy after a hard fought battle.  Satuday Lucy went to see the OSU Beavers play football with some friends.  It was her first real college football game.  She had a ball.  Then on Sunday we went to Carson's soccer game then Andy took the kids to see a University of Portland soccer game.  It was a very fun weekend all the way round :)</div>
