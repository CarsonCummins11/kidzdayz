<div class="post_text">Lucy has joined the Teen Library Council for our local public library.  She had to fill out an application, be interviewed and then wait... She was fairly stressed about the process but was thrilled that she was chosen.  Now she's on the council and gets to help with all kinds of things like helping with book and magazine selection for teens, organizing activities for teens at the library and "marketing" the library to teens.  So far she loves it.  Below is a book review she did which is posted at our local library :)</div>
