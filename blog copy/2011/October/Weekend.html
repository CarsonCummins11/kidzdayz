<div class="post_text">We had a great weekend.  Friday night (no pictures) Lucy and I went to see Oklahoma with some friends.  It was really great!  Andy & Carson went with some guys to see Sunset High School's football game.  Fun night for all of us.  Saturday night Lucy and Andy went on a date (Lucy's gift to Andy for his birthday was gift cards for dinner and a movie :) ).  Carson and I had a night ourselves and went to the gym, Old Navy to buy him some jeans and out for frozen yogurt.  We all enjoyed our  one on one time! </div>

<div class="post_text">Today we spent the day in Pacific City helping Grandma and Papa clear the lot they bought over there.  It was a lot of work but the kids did surprisingly well and worked hard for almost the whole time.  Look at the amazing view we uncovered....</div>
