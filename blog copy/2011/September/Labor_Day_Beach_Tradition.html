<div class="post_text">We just got back from our annual Labor Day trip to the beach with our buddies the Porters and the Towles.Â  We hiked, biked, built all manner of sand structures, forts and dams, had a cook-out on the beach, had a talent show, ate a lot and generally had a fantastic time to wind up the summer!</div>
