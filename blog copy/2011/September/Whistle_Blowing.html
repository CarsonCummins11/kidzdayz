<div class="post_text">The kids are both reffing kick-and-chase (kindergarten and first grade) soccer this year.  Today was the first game.  It was MUCH harder than they thought it would be.  One of the hardest things is actually blowing the whistle loud enough.  They did great in the end.  It was very cute to watch Lucy holding the little kids' hands to walk them over to do a corner kick or a throw in :)</div>
