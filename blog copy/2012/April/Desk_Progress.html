<div class="post_text">The kids had a 4 day weekend for teacher conferences.  Carson spent Friday and Saturday down at Grandma and Papa's working on his desk.  It's mostly done.  In the second photo below you can see it in the background while Carson is working on the shelf that goes below the desk.  He's so very proud of this project and I can't wait to get it!!</div>
