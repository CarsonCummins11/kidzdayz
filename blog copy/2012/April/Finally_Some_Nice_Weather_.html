<div class="post_text">The good news with all the rain we've been getting is that the mountain has gotten a ton of snow!  Today was beautiful so Andy and Carson headed up to the mountain.  They had a great day while Lucy and I got haircuts and did some shopping before Lucy left for an 8 hour b-day party.  I spent the afternoon reading a book in my quiet house!  It couldn't have been better :)</div>
