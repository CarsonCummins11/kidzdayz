<div class="post_text">As part of Andy's continuing sabbatical he took a trip (alone!) through some very remote parts of Eastern Oregon.  He did a lot of cycling, hiking, running, and a bit of camping.  He loved it!  He started at the John Day Fossil Beds which are apparently world renowned for the amazing preservation of the evidence of the climatic changes for the past 50 million years.  There truly are fossils EVERYWHERE!  He brought some rocks home for the kids to split and, indeed there were fossils.</div>

<div class="post_text">Then he went down to the Steens Mountains where he hiked to the tallest mountain in SE Oregon and drove across one of the driest deserts in the US.  Last he headed to the Strawberry Wilderness Area where he hiked to the top of Strawberry Mountain and went on a LONG bike ride all through the Strawberry Wilderness.  He did a lot of driving, saw some amazing scenery along with some extraordinarily remote areas of the state.</div>
