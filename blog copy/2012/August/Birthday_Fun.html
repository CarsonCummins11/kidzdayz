<div class="post_text">Today was my 43rd birthday.  I had such a great day!  Andy and I went for a bike ride this morning followed by lunch out with my good buddy Kathy.  Then our family went for a hike in the Gorge followed by dinner at Ken's Artisan Pizza and cake & ice cream at home!  I couldn't have had a nicer day :) :)</div>
