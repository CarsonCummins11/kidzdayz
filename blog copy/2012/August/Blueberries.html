<div class="post_text">One of the unfortunate side effects of being gone a good portion of the summer is missing most of Oregon's berry picking season.  We picked blueberries today for only the 2nd time this summer.  We've pretty much missed the season.  Last time we went (right after we got home), we got 22lbs.  Today we picked for the same amount of time and only got 7lbs.  I suppose things could be worse... :)</div>
