<div class="post_text">We spent Valentine's night at home with a nice dinner and lots of nice gifts!  The kids, with NO time to prepare, made Andy and I as well as each other the most thoughtful gifts!  Carson folded origami letters spelling out Lucy's name in cool paper.  We're going to frame it, it turned out so cool.  Lucy gave him coupons for free services :)</div>
