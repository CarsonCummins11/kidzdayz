<div class="post_text">What a day!!!  We all feel like we've reached some sort of fairy-tale land.  Despite the forecast for 90% chance of rain today, we woke up early to beautiful sunny skies.  We got up and got moving much earlier than is our norm and were heading up the gondola to start our days journey by 8am.  The day could not have been more spectacular!</div>

<div class="post_text">We started out in the unbelievable town of Murren.  It's carved into the side of the mountain and feels like it's floating when you look out at the views from the main street of town.  We walked through Murren in awe and then caught another tram all the way up to what is called the Schilthorn.  At the very tippy top of an amazing mountain, 9748 feet up, is perched a restaurant called the Piz Gloria.  It's a rotating restaurant and is featured in the James Bond movie "On Her Majesty's Secret Service".  The views were astounding and we were all nearly giddy with how fabulous it was!</div>

<div class="post_text">After that amazing start, we headed back down to Murren to start our Alps hiking experience.  We hiked from Murren through a few small villages to a town (or very small village) called Stechelberg.  The scenery is indescribable.  Around each corner of the hike we were more amazed!  We stopped at a bench by a river in Stechelberg to have our pic-nic lunch.  </div>

<div class="post_text">Lauterbrunnen is in what is known as the valley of 72 waterfalls.  I think we saw about 60 of them today!  After our lunch we hiked along the valley floor to a waterfall called Trummelbach Falls.  I wasn't expecting too much... I'm from Oregon where we have more than our share of waterfalls.  I've seen Niagra Falls and Victoria Falls....  But this was amazing!  We were all astounded by how fantastic this was.  Basically it's an amazing waterfall created by the run-off of the Eiger, the Jungfrau and one other major mountain.  It has carved it's way through the rocks in the mountain.  A big portion of it is not even visisble from below because it's coursing through the rocks of the mountain.  I think you have to see it to believe it, but it was so fantastic!</div>

<div class="post_text">Once we were done with that we'd been on the go for about 7 hours so we made our way back to our apartment where we're going to cook dinner and have a quiet night in! </div>

<div class="post_text">As we were hiking today Carson said "no offense to London and Paris, but Switzerland is by far the coolest place I've seen on this trip".  Lucy said "yeah, Italy better bring it if it wants to beat this!!"  :)  </div>
