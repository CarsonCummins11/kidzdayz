<div class="post_text">Today was the Junior Rose Parade for Carson and a big group of kids from Findley.  It's so cool to watch his progression from year to year on the unicycle.  In 2nd grade I had to walk right beside him and help him get up each time he fell.  In third grade he was getting up on his own and riding in circles, etc - quite proficient.  Now, in fourth grade, he's able to ride forward and backwards as well as being able to idle in one spot for extended periods of time - on both his normal unicycle and the recently acquired giraffe unicycles.  It's very impressive to watch :)</div>
