<div class="post_text">Carson has spent the last half of spring break down with Grandma and Papa.  He is building a desk for he and Lucy to use for homework.  He has gotten to use all the power tools and do at least half the work himself.  He's had a blast!  They're nearly done - next weekend he'll go down and finish. I can't wait to see the final product :)</div>
