<div class="post_text">No big plans for Spring Break this year so I decided to take the kids up to Seattle for a few days.  We rode the train up and stayed downtown.  We got VERY lucky with weather and were able to do all the touristy activities - most of which I'd never done.  We spent a LOT of time at Pikes Place Market (and could go back many more times before we felt like we'd seen it all).  We did the Duck Boat tour, went to the EMP museum (music, sci-fi, and pop culture), saw the Space Needle, rode the ferry over to Bainbridge Island, did the Seattle Underground Tour, and checked out some fun restaurants and shops. </div>
