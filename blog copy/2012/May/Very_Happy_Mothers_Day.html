<h1 class="post_title">Very Happy Mothers Day</h1>

<div class="post_text">Such a fabulous Mothers Day this year!  The day started with Andy making homemade waffles with fruit.  We had a lovely lazy morning at home with me receiving the greatest gifts!  The kids' homemade gifts were so thoughtful and fantastic!  Andy outdid himself with thoughtfulness this year... I often (way too often) complain about having to figure out and make dinner... so, he bought me a whole bunch of restaurant gift cards so I can just pull one of them out whenever I don't feel like cooking!  What a great idea!</div>

<div class="post_text">After our lazy morning (at least lazy for me) at home, we met my family for a pic-nic in the park along with lots of play and relax time.  Overall, a perfect day!</div>

<div class="post_text">Lucy wrote me a beautiful poem to accompany a pinecone-rose she'd found. It's a small pinecone that is perfectly shaped like a rose. She made a little treasure box to put it in and wrote the poem to go along with it. She also bought a frame and framed a picture of she and I when we went surfing :)</div>
