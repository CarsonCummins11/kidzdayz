<div class="post_text">Carson's birthday is tomorrow.  Today we did a small friend celebration.  We took Carson and 4 friends to Big Al's for arcade games followed by the "Wreck It Ralph" movie.  Then they all came home for pizza, cupcakes, presents, and an hour of play time.  They had a blast and are all such sweet boys that it was fun for me as well :)</div>
