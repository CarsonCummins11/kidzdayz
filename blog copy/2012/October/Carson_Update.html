<div class="post_text">Carson has had quite a week!  Last Wednesday he was elected class president!  He wrote a speech and had to speak in front of the whole class.  There were 7 or 8 kids who also ran for "office" but he won.  He was VERY excited!  </div>

<div class="post_text">Then last weekend we went to Seattle for his first ever traveling soccer tournament.  His team made it into the Northwest Champions League which is a fairly big deal and last weekend was the big tournament.  We all went, stayed in a hotel with the rest of the team and had all kinds of fun activities along with some soccer :).. The boys did really well but only won one of 3 games.  It was a great experience anyway and they all thought it was very cool!</div>

<div class="post_text">We got home late Sunday night and he was up and out for school on Monday.  After school Monday I got a call from the chess club manager telling me that Carson had a stomach ache.  I went and picked him up around 4:15 and by 6 we were in the ER.  He ended up throwing up every 15-20 minutes, his fever shot up to 104+ and he had severe abdominal pain.  There was a fear that it was an appendicitis but we think now that it was either just an amazingly awful virus or a very severe case of food poisoning.  It's been a long few days for him but he was pretty much back to normal this morning.  He's back at school so we'll see how he does.</div>
