<div class="post_text">One thing we hadn't gotten to this summer was a trip to the beach.  Last weekend we made it to Cannon Beach and got to play on the beach for about an hour before the rain started.  Then we skipped out picnic lunch plan and had a lovely meal at a pub.  Gotta love the Oregon Coast in August :)</div>
