<div class="post_text">We had a crazy weekend this weekend which culminated in Lucy having a dance competition on Sunday.  We left home at 7:20am and didn't get back until almost 3.  Lucy and I were there for 6 hours watching a version of "Dance Mom's" play out...  Quite a day!  Lucy's group won first in the category and 4th in their level :)</div>
