<div class="post_text">We've had some dustings of snow and some severely cold weather.  Well at Lucy's school girls are coming from all over the place so on Tuesday they decided to have a 2 hour late start.  Lucy was already up when we figured it out and she knew that Carson would be very jealous of her late start so she made him a lovely eggs and toast breakfast.  It cheered him right up and started my day off on a good note :)</div>
