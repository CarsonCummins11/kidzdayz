<div class="post_text">Carson and I spent the day Friday at Biztown.  It's a simulated city that is fully run by the kids for the day.  Each kid applies for and then gets a job.  They all have personal checking accounts they get to manage.  Each business has a full days worth of "real-life" issues they get to manage.  It is so much fun for the kids!  They spend weeks in advance learning and preparing for when they actually get there.  When they are there they are crazy busy all day long.  It was so funny to see every kid running around worried about the invoice that had to be paid when we haven't even gotten our deposits in yet... etc.  They all took it so seriously!  I was volunteering at City Hall which was a lot of fun.  At the end of the long, busy day I asked the kids if they thought this is what it was like for their parents when they went to work - they all said "no way, I barely had time to eat lunch!"  :)</div>

<div class="post_text">Carson was the CEO of Century Link.  I didn't get to talk with him most of the day as he was running around busy all day long.  At one point I saw him running from one thing to the next and he said "Sorry mom, I can't talk, things are blowing up for me right now" .  Great Experience!!!</div>
