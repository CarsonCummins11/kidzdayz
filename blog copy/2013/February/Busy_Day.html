<div class="post_text">Busy day at our house.  Lucy had a fencing tournament and Carson (and a group of kids from school) was the half time entertainment for the University of Portland basketball game.  Of course they overlapped so we split up.  Both kids did well and then got to spend the whole evening doing homework :)</div>
