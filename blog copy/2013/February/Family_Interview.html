<div class="post_text">I can't believe we're thinking about high school for Lucy, but that's where we are.  At the moment the budget for our school district is a bit of a mess so we've been looking in to private schools.  Today we had our first family interview.  Mostly it was a Lucy interview with a few questions for Andy and I at the end.  Lucy did a great job answering the questions.  We'll see what happens....</div>
