<div class="post_text">Very fun and rushed Valentines Day this year!  First we have a quick video of Carson's final Valentines Box for school.  Aesthetically it wasn't the best but it was super cool :)  For our family Valentines evening, after the various activities and practices we got take-out and had LOTS of treats :)  and then watched a Modern Family episode - perfect night :).</div>
