<div class="post_text">Yesterday was Lucy's 14th birthday!  Not sure how that happened!!  We all went for a run in Forest Park in the morning followed by a family brunch.  In the afternoon Lucy had a few friends over and had a pool party which she loved!  They had a great time!  I feel like it's official now - the teenager years have begun.</div>
