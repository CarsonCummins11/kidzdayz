<div class="post_text">Carson had his last developmental track meet this weekend.  The only thing left now is the "Meet of Champions" on the 18th and 19th.  He has definitely found a new passion!  He loves track and can't wait for cross country in the fall.  This meet he ran the 1500, 800 and the 4X400 relay.</div>
