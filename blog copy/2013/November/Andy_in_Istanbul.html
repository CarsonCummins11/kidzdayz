<div class="post_text">Andy's on a work trip to Istanbul.  He's never been so went a day or two early so he could see the sites.  He had horrible luck with flights getting there and then they lost his luggage.  However, he assures me he's having a great time.  Fingers crossed his luggage will get to him soon so he doesn't have to go buy a new suit in Istanbul!!</div>
