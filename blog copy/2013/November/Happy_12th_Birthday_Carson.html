<div class="post_text">Today my little boy turned 12!  Yesterday we had 9  boys over to our house.  They all went to a movie (thankfully!) then came back for pizza and cupcakes followed by a truly insane nerf gun battle that shook the entire house.  I think we're all done with indoor birthday parties at our house!  Carson had a great time though :)  Then tonight we had his favorite dinner and opened presents with just our family.  I'd say we've successfully accomplished another birthday.</div>
