<div class="post_text">Didn't do a great job of taking pics but got some of the prep and clean up :)  The kids went down on Wednesday night to help get everything ready.  Carson's very favorite is mashed potatoes and gravy so he gets to help with that every year. I'm pretty sure he could do it on his own now!</div>
