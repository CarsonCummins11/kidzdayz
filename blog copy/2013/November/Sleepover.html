<div class="post_text">Dad's in Istanbul so we're having a very kid-focused weekend (not unlike all other weekends really).  Lucy had two buddies stay the night Friday, we all went to dinner and the girls went to a movie after.  Carson and I got some bonding time shopping :)  He loved it!  Trying on pants with mom... what could be better on a Friday night??</div>
