<div class="post_text">Lucy's school does an immersion day where they spend the day in Old Town Portland learning about homelessness in our community.  It was an eye-opening experience for us all.  I think the biggest impact on the girls was the fact that there are approximately 1500 homeless teens in Portland and only 80 shelter beds available on any given night.</div>
