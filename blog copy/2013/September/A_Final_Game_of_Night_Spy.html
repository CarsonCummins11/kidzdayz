<div class="post_text">Our kids and the Porter girls have long been playing a game they call "night spy".  They dress up in ninja gear and we hide one note per team somewhere in the yard.  They have to go find the note and make it back to the deck without ever being seen by the adults on the deck.  The first team back wins.</div>
