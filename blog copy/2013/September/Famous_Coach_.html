<div class="post_text">Carson is running cross country for Nike.  He has several truly fantastic coaches.  One is Shalane Flanagan who just happens to be one of the most decorated US women's runners of all time.  She is currently running for Nike and helping out coaching the Nike middle school team.  He was somewhat impressed but not as impressed as I was.  He loved me taking pictures :)  She's the one in the red hat.</div>
