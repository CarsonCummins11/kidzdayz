<div class="post_text">On Saturday after Carson's team lost a game they probably should have won, Carson talked to his coach and asked what he could do to improve his game.  The coach said he was doing well but could work on his quickness (whatever that means).  Carson took it very seriously.  He went straight home and looked up on Google how to improve soccer quickness.  He then set up cones and spent a very long time working on "drills".  He did it again on Sunday morning and they won their game that afternoon.  He's convinced it works!  I love the dedication but just wish his coach would have said something about keeping his room clean or something of more use to me :)</div>
