<div class="post_text">We missed Carson's second track meet while we were away but Lucy did a great job of reporting out to us!  Carson came took first place in the 800 Meters, first place in the 4X400 Meter relay and was beat out at the very last second for first place in the 1500 Meter - he came in a very close second.  Happy boy :)</div>
