<div class="post_text">This morning was the Stoller (our local (and Carson's) middle school) 5K.  This was it's second year and our second year.  We all ran again.  Last year Carson got first place in his age group.  This year he was edged out at the line by his buddy.  However, he still came in a very respectable 10th out of 560 runners and 2nd in his age group with a smoking fast time of 20:30.  Andy and Lucy ran together and they finished just before me.  We were back at spots 54, 55 and 57 all round 24:30.  A great way to start the morning and so much fun that we all can do it now :)  Lucy came in 3rd in her age group but would have finished 1st if she'd already turned 15 :(  She was bummed about that.  I came in 3rd so no ribbon for me.  Andy had a more competitive bracket and came in 8th in his age group :)</div>
