<div class="post_text">Carson's Cross Country team has started the season a little early with some fun summer races.  One night a week they're doing  a themed race at the Nike Campus.  Last night they did a prediction run where they had to predict their time.  A great way to start back up.  Of course there were Olympians on hand which always makes things more fun!</div>
