<div class="post_text">Lucy joined the cross country ski team at school and had her first race this weekend over in Bend (about 3.5 hours from here).  Andy was one of the drivers so took 5 girls over for the weekend :)  They had a beautiful day for the race and Lucy absolutely LOVED it!  She did very well and was counted as varsity for this race since she came in in the top 5 on her team!  Carson had two soccer games so we stayed home for the weekend and had lots of fun!</div>
