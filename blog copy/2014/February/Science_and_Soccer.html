<div class="post_text">Carson and I got up early on Saturday to drive to Lebanon Oregon for a practice round of the Science Olympiad.  Carson's on a team of 15 sixth-eighth graders who will compete in 23 events.  Each event has 1-3 people assigned.  Carson is doing 3 events.  The first is Rotor Egg Drop.  They had to design an unpowered helicopter device which uses one or more rotors to safely transport a raw egg from a specified height.  They did pretty well in this one.  The egg did not break but they definitely have some tweeking to do as it dropped pretty quickly and a slower drop gets more points.  His second event is Robo Cross where they had to design a robot to perform certain tasks on a course.  Again, the robot did well but they have some tweeking to do to make it complete the tasks a bit quicker.  His last event is a "knowledge event" where he and a partner had to take a test on the Solar System.  I am the "coach" for the Solar System event.  I have learned a LOT over the past few months!  After a long day competing in Lebanon we hustled back to Portland to make it to Carson's soccer game.  Big day for the two of us!</div>
