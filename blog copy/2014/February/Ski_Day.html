<div class="post_text">It has been a crazy weather year here (and everywhere else too, I know)!  We had no snow in the mountains up until a few weeks ago.  Now we've got a ton of snow!  We finally made it up to go cross country skiing for the first time today!  Had a fabulous day doing some serious back country trekking near Trillium Lake on Mt. Hood.  So much fun!!</div>
