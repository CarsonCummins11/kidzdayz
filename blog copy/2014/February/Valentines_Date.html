<div class="post_text">Carson did not have school on Valentines Day this year.  He very much wanted to "take me out" for the afternoon :).  We went for a fantastic lunch downtown followed by a trip to "Classic Arcade" where we played a lot of PacMan and pinball machines then we headed to Powell's City of Books (our very favorite place) for the rest of the afternoon.  It was a lovely way to spend the day.  Lucy went ice skating with friends after school and then we all went to dinner together that evening.  Great way to spend a Friday night :)</div>
