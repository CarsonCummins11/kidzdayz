<div class="post_text">Fun weekend at our house.  Lucy spent all day Saturday at an acting competition where she and a friend performed a duo piece.  They got an honorable mention placing in the top 20% :).  Andy and Carson spent a good portion of the day doing the dreaded science fair board (my very least favorite activity!)</div>
