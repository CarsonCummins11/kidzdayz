<div class="post_text">When we were in NY we were introduced to the most fun backyard game ever... Kan Jam!  Carson especially fell in love with it.  Well, today we came home (both pretty tired) and found a big package at our door.  The wonderful Aunt Patsy had sent us the game!  Carson has been in the back yard practicing since he got it!  :)  Thanks Aunt Patsy!!</div>
