<div class="post_text">Last Day of 6th and 9th grades!  Carson had a full day and Lucy was half.  Carson had a talent show at school where he did a hip-hop dance/unicycle show.  There were no "winners" but he assures me that MANY people told him that he'd have won if there were winners named :).  I think it's awesome that 1) he's willing to put himself out there like that and 2) he's able to choreograph a cool routine like he did (he gave us a sneak preview at home) :).  After school Lucy had a pool party (with sketchy weather) with 6 of her friends.  Carson went to a movie and then went and shot his air soft gun with dad.</div>
