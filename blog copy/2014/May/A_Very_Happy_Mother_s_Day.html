<div class="post_text">Such a great Mother's Day this year!  After a super fun Friday/Saturday with Lucy, Sunday morning I slept in then the whole family went for a run.  Everyone ran at my pace, which for some is pretty darned slow :).  Then while I showered Andy made a fabulous brunch, then we all headed over to my sister Jamie's for a family dinner/play time.  A truly great day where I felt spoiled and blessed!</div>
