<div class="post_text">On Friday night Carson got to participate in the Oregon Twilight Track Meet at Hayward Field (Uof O) down in Eugene.  Each year at this meet middle schoolers from all over the state are invited to participate in the "Middle School Mile".  It is an extraordinarily competitive event and such a rush for the middle-school kids to participate in a college meet.  It is 6th-8th graders and one of Carson's buddies from his team won the whole thing running the mile in 4:47!  Carson simply wanted to break 6 minutes which he did soundly with a time of 5:47.  He and Andy both had a blast at the event!  Lucy and I were very sad to miss it as we were at her schools Mother/Daughter beach weekend.</div>
