<div class="post_text">Best-Dad-Ever points for Andy on Saturday.  I planned a night with Lucy and 3 friends and Carson and one friend to go to the Haunted Corn Maze.  At the last minute we decided that it would probably be good for an adult to go in with the boys as it was their first time.  I absolutely HATE haunted anything so Andy stepped up to take everyone.  They all had a fabulous time and I had a lovely evening at home alone :) :)</div>
