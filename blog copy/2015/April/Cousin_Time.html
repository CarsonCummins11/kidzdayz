<div class="post_text">After Carson ran the Stoller 5K in the morning on Sunday he came home and finished a paper for school and then headed straight to a State Cup soccer game followed immediately by heading to watch his young cousin play flag football followed by a family dinner.  Big day for him!  We got home and he showered and then collapsed!</div>

<div class="post_text">Also, just 6 months ago we have pictures of Carson with Mackenzie (the cousin in the middle who is only 6 months younger) where they are almost the same height!  Wow!  No wonder none of his clothes fit!</div>
