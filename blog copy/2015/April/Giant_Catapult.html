<div class="post_text">Carson decided he wanted to build a giant catapult.  He drew out the design and talked Andy into taking him to Home Depot to buy the supplies.  It was so big it got stuck in the net of the basketball hoop but it was very cool!  It still needs some stabilization for the arms and approval from mom for what is being catapulted but otherwise he's good to go :)</div>
