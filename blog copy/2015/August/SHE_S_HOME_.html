<div class="post_text">After 3 very long weeks Lucy got home at nearly midnight on Sunday.  She had a fantastic experience but we are all very glad she's home!!!  Given the time of night there wasn't much open so we went to Shari's and got some pie to celebrate her homecoming.  Lucy will be doing a guest post soon to document her experience :)</div>
