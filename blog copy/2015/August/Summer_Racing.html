<div class="post_text">Carson's XC running club has been doing a few races this summer.  Saturday night they had a pretty big-time 5K at Nike with a lot of the high end elite runners.  The guy who won the race did so with a time of 14:34.  That is 4:40 mile pace!!  In fact the top 10 finishers were all under 5 minutes/mile!  It was pretty awesome to watch some of these people run!  Carson did really great!  His goal was to finish under 19 minutes.  He did it in 18:57, averaging 6:06 miles.  He finished 82nd out of 570 which isn't bad in this type of a crowd!  He LOVES this group of guys and running these races!! :)</div>
