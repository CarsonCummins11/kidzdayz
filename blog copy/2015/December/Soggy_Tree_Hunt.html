<div class="post_text">El Nino is real and has indeed hit the Pacific Northwest!  We have had an insane amount of rain.  We were trying to hold out for the rain to slow down but no luck.  We got very muddy and thoroughly soaked but were successful and found a tree.  We were much less picky than we have been in the past, but a tree is a tree :)</div>
