<div class="post_text">Well, I was kind of thinking this day wouldn't actually come... I was wrong.  Lucy flew out last night on the red-eye to Houston and then on to Managua, Nicaragua where she was picked up for her 4 hour bus ride to Limon, the village she'll be working in for the next 3 weeks.  She'll be living with a family and working in a health clinic there.  She's been so excited!!  I'm dying to hear how it's going!  I did get a message that she made it OK but haven't heard from her directly yet...</div>
