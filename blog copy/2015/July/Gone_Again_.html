<div class="post_text">We had an early morning today as we took Carson to the bus for his 7 hour trip to Southeastern Oregon for a running camp.  He doesn't really know anyone going but is so far beyond excited!  He's been looking forward to and training for this camp since we signed him up in January.  This is the first year he's old enough to do it.  It's predominantly high school kids and is VERY intense!  One of the days they will run over 30 miles!  They are staying in a very remote area at 7500 feet elevation.  No phones, no running water, sleeping in tents... all sounds hideous to me!  He gets to take "baths" in a river all week ... We will hear nothing from him until we pick him up on Saturday night.  Fingers crossed he makes friends, doesn't get hurt, survives the running and has fun!!!</div>
