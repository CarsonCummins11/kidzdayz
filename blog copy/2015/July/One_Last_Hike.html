<div class="post_text">As we prepare for Lucy to head off to Nicaragua, we're spending lots of time buying, planning and packing!  However, we're also spending lots of time doing some of the fun stuff Lucy enjoys before she's off for 3 weeks :)  Today we went hiking with Zoe in Forest Park - lots of fun :)</div>
