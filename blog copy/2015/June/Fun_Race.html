<div class="post_text">On Saturday Carson ran a race that was put on by some high school boys to raise money for a charity.  It was a very low-key event with not a ton of entrants but Carson got first place by a lot and had a lot of attention from the high school boys, parents and coaches asking where he was going to high school and wondering if he'd be interested in transferring to their school :)  He couldn't have been more proud!</div>
