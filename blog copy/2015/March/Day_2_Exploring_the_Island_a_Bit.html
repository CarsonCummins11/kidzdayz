<div class="post_text">On Day 2 we headed out to a VERY (maybe too!) famous snorkel beach.  We snorkeled for a few hours but were slightly underwhelmed by what we saw and overwhelmed by the crowds so we headed to the much quieter beach where President Obama likes to hang out when he's in Hawaii.  We spent the afternoon boogie boarding.  Actually the kids and Andy boogie boarded while I read a book and took pictures.  Pure heaven!!</div>
