<div class="post_text">Friday may well have been my favorite day.  We rented an umbrella and two lounge chairs on the beach for the entire day and that's where I stayed reading my book alternating with swimming to cool off!  Lucy hung with me for a while and then went off to meet up with two friends from school who both happened to be staying at the same hotel as us.  Andy and Carson came for a while but then headed off to a sports bar to watch the NCAA tournament for a while and then to play soccer a bit (we never travel without a ball!).  That night our hotel had a fantastic fireworks display and then we went for a long walk along the beach!  Truly sensational!</div>
