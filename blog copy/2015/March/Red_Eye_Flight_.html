<div class="post_text">We flew home on the red-eye Saturday night so spent the day boogie boarding and then headed back to the hotel for quick showers and dinner and then off to our 11:15pm flight.  All went smoothly, however, we'd flown out of Bellingham, WA which is a little over 4 hours away (it was WAY cheaper) so Andy got to drive us all the way home after a day of boogie boarding and a night of flying!  It was a bit precarious at times!  We're all pretty worn out as we head back into our routine but it was a trip well worth it!!</div>
