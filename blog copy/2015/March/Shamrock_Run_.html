<div class="post_text">This morning Andy and Carson ran the 8k Shamrock Run in downtown Portland.  This is a massive event in Portland with a 15k race, a half marathon, the 8k and a 5k.  Carson planned to run the whole thing with Andy because he had a soccer game later in the afternoon and didn't want to overdo it.  However, at mile 3.5 Andy had to stop to tie his shoe and told Carson to take off.  Carson ended up passing over 100 people and ended the race in 145th place out of more than 6000 runners!  Andy ended a respectable 282nd :)</div>
