<div class="post_text">This weekend was Lucy's State Nordic Ski Championship.  Friday was the 6.4k skate race which was crazy hard in crazy snowy, windy weather!  Saturday was the 5k classic race and the weather couldn't have been any more different.  Lucy had her best race of the season and a super-fun weekend in Bend :)</div>
