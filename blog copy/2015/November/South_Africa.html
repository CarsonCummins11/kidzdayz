<div class="post_text">Andy just returned from a business trip to South Africa.  He had a day at the beginning and the end of the week to do a bit of looking around.  He went to the 'Cradle of Humanity' and the 'Apartheid Museum' both of which were very cool.  He also had a day when the guy who was driving him around got lost so he saw a bit of the scarier side of the city.  Other than the ridiculously long flight (if you google the longest flight in the world you'll see it's number 2) where he got to sit in the middle sit in one of the last rows - good times!! :)</div>
