<div class="post_text">An exceptionally disgusting day for a race!!  Carson's state cross country race was on Saturday and the weather couldn't have been less cooperative!  It was cold, dumping rain and crazy windy.  And the mud!!! Many kids fell, Carson had one big slip - it was crazy.  Carson had his worst race of the season but still qualified for the Regionals race.  Two more weeks of training and fingers crossed for a much better race :)</div>
