<div class="post_text">For his 50th birthday Andy decided to train for a 50K trail race so Carson and I joined him in Boise this weekend for the big event.  Apparently the first 14 miles were straight up hill on a single track trail (most of it in the dark!).  After that it was a lot of up and down but sounds like a tough course.  He finished first in his age group and 20th overall (out of about 130 racers) and had a blast!</div>
