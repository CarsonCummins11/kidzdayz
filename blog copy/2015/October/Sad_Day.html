<div class="post_text">On Thursday October 22, 2015 Andy's dad Hugh T. Cummins passed away in Terre Haute, IN.  He was 91 years old, a small business owner, father of 6 and grandfather of 14 kids who all loved him very much.  He was a kind and generous man who was very fondly remembered by many at his wake this week.  We were lucky to have had him in our lives!</div>
