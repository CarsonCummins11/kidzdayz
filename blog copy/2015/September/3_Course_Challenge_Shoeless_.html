<div class="post_text">We were lucky today that both kids ran in the same race.  They ran the 3 Course Challenge out at the beach.  It's a tough course with a massive mud pit that the kids have to run through.  Carson's was the first race of the day.  He started off really well. At 400 meters they hit the mud pit.  Carson managed to lose both shoes in the pit!  He ran the rest of the race (most of it) in his socks!  He actually finished pretty fast given his circumstances!  Makes for a great story for him now :)  Andy had to really dig to find the shoes!  Lucy had to run the last race of the day.  The one that is labeled 'hard', and hard it was, some very massive hills, the mud pit and a lot of sand!  We got lucky with the weather and had a very fun day :)</div>
