<div class="post_text">Another beautiful day Sunday so we went for a long family bike ride.  Had a fabulous time until Andy got a flat tire.  He got to wait at a park while I rode back for the car.  The kids, on the other hand, finished our ride including the trip for ice cream we'd planned for the end of the ride :).  Nice that they're old enough to do this stuff on their own!</div>
