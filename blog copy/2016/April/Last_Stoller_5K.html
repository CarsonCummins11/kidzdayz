<div class="post_text">8th grade means the last Stoller 5K.  Carson was really hoping to win it this year and came pretty darned close!  He came in 3rd overall out of 881 racers beating his time from last year by more than a minute!  Pretty good given the illness and the insane amount of activity over the weekend!  Andy came in first in his age group and 33rd overall.  A pretty darned successful morning all the way around.  Carson then spent the afternoon playing soccer and riding bikes with his buddy.  Man how I'd love to have his level of energy!!</div>
