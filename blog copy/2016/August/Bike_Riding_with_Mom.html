<div class="post_text">Carson and I went on a bike ride together with him riding Andy's racing bike.  It is shocking to see him ride.  When we were going uphill I truly looked and felt like I was riding backwards!  And this was after he'd had practice running hill repeats with his team all morning.  He's not allowed to go out on his own on the roads yet so he's stuck with me :)!  Not sure if I was really like that at 14 but it would be nice to be in that type of shape again!!  Afterward he had a fresh brewed root beer to celebrate :)</div>
