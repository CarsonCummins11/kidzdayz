<div class="post_text">Andy declared it the weekend of Shannon :)  Such fun!  Friday night we all went to dinner and a movie.  Saturday we had Carson's Miles that Matter fundraiser in the morning and a grown-ups night out with my sister Jamie and her husband Sean.  Sunday I signed Andy & Carson up for a Map and GPS class.  They were gone until 2pm.  Lucy and I walked Zoe and then met my parents for a lovely lunch.  When the boys were home we went hiking, watched the Olympic Marathon and then had a fabulous scavenger hunt the kids had organized!  They bought all my favorite candies, decorated 12 mason jars and filled them with all different candy.  It was a truly fantastic gift!  We finished up the day with cake and ice cream.  I couldn't have asked for a better birthday :)</div>
