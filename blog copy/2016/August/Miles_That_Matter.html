<div class="post_text">We just participated in the coolest event with Carson's cross country team!  It's called Miles That Matter.  It's a 24 hour run on the school track.  Current athletes, alumni, parents, etc. all signed up for times and ran or walked around the track.  I had the 4am slot with a great group of moms.  Carson and Andy went at 7:30am.  At the end (10am) the whole team ran a mile around the track with the coach and his new twin babies and then had a big pancake breakfast.  50% of the proceeds from the kids fundraising goes to Shriner's Children's Hospital.  Such a great group of kids and parents!</div>
