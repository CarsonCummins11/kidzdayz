<div class="post_text">So fun when you live somewhere that doesn't get a ton of snow to have our first snow day!  Thanks to the fact that we live among some serious hills/mountains and the city doesn't have a lot of plowing equipment as well as the fact that we often have some nasty ice after snow, the kids got 2 days off school!  Very exciting ;)</div>
