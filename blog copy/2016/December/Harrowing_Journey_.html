<div class="post_text">Yesterday was an insane commute day!!  It started snowing hard around noon.  Schools didn't dismiss early so things got crazy fast around 3pm!  Lucy drives to a transit center and takes the train to school every day.  She got out of school at 2:10 and took the train to the transit center as usual.  However, her drive home was anything but usual!  The 3.2 mile drive which typically takes around 10 minutes took her a full 3 hours!  She got to drive through snow, ice and some very slick roads!  After she'd been sitting at one intersection for 1.5 hours, a police officer came walking by telling everyone they had to close the road because 3 crashes had already occurred at the bottom of the hill!  She then turned around and drove through "an obstacle course" of abandoned and stuck cars to get home!  She was SUPER proud of herself and stayed in very good spirits about the whole thing!  She came in the door playing "We Are The Champions" on her phone :).  Andy on the other hand, took about 1.5 hours to do his typical 20 minute commute and he didn't view it as quite as big of an adventure ;)  Carson's school bus was over 2 hours late!  He made the wise decision early on to hop off the bus and walk home!  Some schools around the city had kids picked up as late as 10pm!  It was a truly insane evening!!</div>
