<div class="post_text">Carson had to run 8 miles this morning and really wanted Lucy to go with him on her bike.  She really didn't want to go as he goes pretty fast and it's 32 degrees and foggy this morning, she feared she'd freeze!  Instead she promised to make him a nice breakfast.  She and I went out for a much slower run with Zoe but she did come through with the nice breakfast!  Trying to look good for Santa!!</div>
