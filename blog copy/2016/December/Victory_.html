<div class="post_text">A shocking amount of work has gone into college applications at our house!  Lucy applied to three schools early action (meaning she finds out early about acceptance but isn't required to go there).  She has now heard back from 2 of the 3 and was accepted to both Northeastern University and Georgetown!!  She's VERY excited to have some good news in the beginning.  She'll find out about one more on Monday and then the others (8 more I think) will trickle in over the next few months culminating in her decision by (I think) May 1st.  What a nerve-wracking and painful process!!</div>
