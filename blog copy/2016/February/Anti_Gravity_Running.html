<div class="post_text">Carson hurt his hamstring a while back and has been going to PT to get himself back to soccer and running.  He has been going insane to get back to running!  Today he was deemed OK to try out running in the anti gravity running pod.  It allows you to run at as low as 10% of your body weight.  He was so unbelievably thrilled to be running again!  It was a cool experience all the way around.  He's able to try outside running this weekend and he couldn't be more happy!!</div>
