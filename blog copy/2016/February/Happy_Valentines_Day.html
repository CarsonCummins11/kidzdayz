<div class="post_text">We had a lovely Valentines Day this year.  Carson has hurt his hamstring so couldn't play the two soccer games he was scheduled to play so we had a little more time at home than expected.  Andy and I went for a run together, Lucy volunteered all morning then we all went for a late lunch/early dinner and did gifts.  A nice and somewhat mellow day all around :)</div>
