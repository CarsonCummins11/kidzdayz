<div class="post_text">Carson has been playing on a team over winter break, not his normal team.  He's had a great time even though all of the games have been in fairly disgusting weather.  I hadn't been to any of the games (mostly due to the disgusting weather) so decided to go last night.  It was very fun to watch but man it was freezing!!  They won 2-1 :)</div>
