<div class="post_text">We got a dusting of snow which was plenty for sledding :)  Lucy was gone with friends so Carson talked Andy into going out.  You go much faster with two people on the sled!  The best part was the freezing rain we got that night which ensured a snow day the first day back to school after break!</div>
