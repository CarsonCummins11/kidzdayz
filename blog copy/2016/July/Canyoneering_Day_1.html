<div class="post_text">We got in fairly late on Saturday but were up early Sunday for our first day of canyoneering!  We were with another family of 4 and two guides.  We went through two slot canyons and it was truly an amazing experience.  We rappelled down short and tall cliff faces, we shimmied through canyons which were, at times, so narrow we could barely fit sliding sideways, we trudged through water sometimes up to our chests (especially for those of us who are a bit shorter!).  We learned the seated bridge (where you shimmy along with your butt on one wall and your feet on another over an obstacle below), the body bridge (arms on one wall and feet on the other... think plank position with a pool of water below you) and the star bridge (one foot on either wall).  We slid down canyon walls using friction to stop ourselves from plummeting 15 feet to the rocks below and learned to help one another through some pretty crazy situations!  We saw amazing views and didn't see a single other human the entire day!  We ended the day exhausted!  My arms were literally shaking from the exertion!  We were all a bit scraped up and bruised but it was such a fantastic experience!  Dinner that night was a blast as we recounted the adventure of the day :)  Some of us were more sure than others about our ability to manage another full day of this fabulousness!!  Little did we know that day 2 would be a completely new level of CRAZY!!!!</div>
