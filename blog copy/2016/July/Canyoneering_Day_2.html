<div class="post_text">The tragedy of day 2 was that my camera died at the very beginning of the day!  Little did I know the level of crazy we were getting into and the pictures I would miss!  I was so far outside my comfort zone on so many levels that day that I'm not entirely sure how I didn't have a panic attack on multiple occasions!!  Carson loved every minute of it and is ready to sign up as a guide in training!  Lucy wasn't far behind him but had a few moments of trepidation.  Andy was braver than me by a lot but was well aware of the seriously crazy nature of our adventure for the day!</div>

<div class="post_text">It was just the 4 of us and two guides.  We started early and drove out to the middle of nowhere to start our adventure.  We started off with a rappel of about 80 feet just to get us to the top of the canyon wall.  We hiked a ways and then had a 200 foot rappel down a very sheer cliff face!  I thought that was going to be the scary part of the day!  Shows what I know!  After rappelling down into the canyon, the real adventure began.  We started out with a very long stretch of canyon so high and so narrow that we had to slide through sideways.  Our feet had to be facing forward while our bodies were sideways with our packs above our heads.  Even with this awkward position, my feet got stuck often because it was so narrow!  It was also so tall that we couldn't see the top of the canyon.  This is where my claustrophobia really started kicking in.  I could hear Lucy ahead of me shouting back words of encouragement.  I'm not entirely sure they were only for me... I think there were times when she was a bit stressed as well!  Not only were we going through a canyon so narrow you couldn't really take a deep breath, but at various times we were also trudging through said canyon in very cold water almost up to my neck!  Insane!!!  We finally made it through this very long stretch of way-too-narrow canyon and I breathed a huge (and premature!) sigh of relief!  We got to hike for a ways in a regular (and beautiful!) canyon.  It was glorious if a little too short-lived!  We learned that hiking through a canyon is not simply hiking through a canyon!  The canyon has high points and low points that have to be navigated as well as the water from the recent rains!  We rappelled some more, we used all of our fabulous bridging techniques, we shimmied through tight spots and relied some more on friction (often from our bare arms and legs) to stop our descents down sheer cliff faces to reach the next step down along the way.  The most shocking experience for all of us came toward the very end of the VERY long canyon!  We reached a point where we had to rappel about 25 feet into a large pool of very cold water that was so deep none of us could touch the bottom!  Carson went first.  He had to rappel down into the water.  Once he was floating in the water he called up to the guide who gave him slack in the rope so he could detach himself.  He was then told to swim to the other side of the pool where there was a 3 foot high rock wall.  He was then told to hold his breath and swim under the wall through an approximately 5 foot long tunnel to get to the pool below where he'd be able to get out!  The second guide went first so was able to give a little advice and assistance but basically we were on our own!  It was unbelievably scary!!!!  I thought it was pretty cool when I watched Andy and Carson do it but when it was my turn it scared me beyond anything I can describe.  I got down into the freezing water that was filled with pine needles and juniper berries (and I don't want to think of what else) and was so freaked out I can't believe I actually swam under that rock wall!  Lucy went last and was appropriately almost as scared by it as I was!  After that (and probably 5 hours in) we were nearly done with the canyon.  Just one last massive rappel left down into the riverbed.  We made it out of the canyon and were able to stop and have a very late lunch.  We were all so giddy one might have confused us with drunks!  It was such a rush but I'm not sure if our giddiness was from the adventure or the thrill of knowing we were done!  Probably a little of both to varying degrees for different people!</div>

<div class="post_text">We enjoyed a nice break sitting in the sun beside the river before we started the hike out.  I wasn't worried at all about the hike out.  Hiking I can do.  Even when I'm tired I can trudge one foot in front of the other.  However, this was no normal hiking!!  Oh, it was fine for a while... we hiked along beside the river and saw the rock art left by the natives who'd made their homes in the river valleys thousands of years before.  We had to do quite a bit of bush-whacking but, again, that I can do!  Then, at some point, I realized that if we'd rappelled down the cliff face to get into the canyon and then spent hours hiking down the canyon... at some point we'd have to get back up!  This is where my fear of heights and my EXTREME fear of sheer cliff faces came in.  We literally walked, and at times crawled in my case, straight up the sheer cliff face.  I was assured that it was all fine because our shoes were "pretty sticky".  What the hell?!?!?  This is the part of the journey were I wanted to cry!  I'd made it through (and watched my family make it through) this unbelievable canyon only to watch one of us plummet off a 1,000 foot cliff face?!?!  The guide was fantastic and could tell I was starting to panic.  He stayed just below me and showed me where to step, even holding my hand at times.  I had to put one foot in front of the other and just not look down!  If I'd have known what I was getting myself into, I most definitely would not have started the hike up.  That said, I made it and we all survived!  It was truly the most spectacular day of adventure we've shared to date!  No regrets now :-)</div>
