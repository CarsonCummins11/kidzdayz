<div class="post_text">Carson is super excited to start training for triathlons.  He and Andy are working on transferring Andy's racing bike to Carson.  It's pretty different to ride a racing bike so they went out to the Banks Vernonia trail for a long ride without traffic to see how he did.  He LOVED it!  Andy's pretty jazzed because not only does he have a new training and racing buddy but he's likely to get a new bike out of it :)</div>
