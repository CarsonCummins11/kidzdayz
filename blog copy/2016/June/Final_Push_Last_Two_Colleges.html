<div class="post_text">Andy got to go on the final two college visits.  They visited University of Chicago on Monday and Washington University in St. Louis on Tuesday.  Both were very popular fan favorites!  This brings our final college visit total to 28 I believe.  I definitely feel like we've covered all our bases and done our due diligence now it's all up to her, just a matter of applying and seeing where she gets in!</div>
