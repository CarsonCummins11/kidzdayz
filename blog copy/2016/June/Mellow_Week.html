<div class="post_text">Carson's first full week with no school and he was home with just me.  I think he enjoyed just hanging out a bit but he got a bit bored as well!  However he did start high school cross country practice so he's running a TON and loving it!!  We did spend time hiking in forest park, went to several movies, went out for dinner and played with Haylie some.  Not a bad week overall :)</div>
