<div class="post_text">We only had one full day in Buffalo but had so much fun!  We started with a fabulous meal with our equally fabulous nephews Ben & Andrew on Thursday night.  On Friday we spent the day learning about and touring Buffalo.  I knew Buffalo was a pretty great place from our last visit but this time we learned a lot about it's history and architecture.   A truly fantastic tour followed by a lovely, relaxing time with Patsy, Jerry and Roxy :)</div>
