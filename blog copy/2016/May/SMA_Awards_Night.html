<div class="post_text">Last night was the St. Mary's Academy Awards Night.  What a night for Lucy!  First she was inducted into the National Honor Society.  After that was the main awards ceremony.  Lucy was chosen to receive 3 awards.  First she was chosen as the best US History student in the school.  Second, she received the American Chemical Society Outstanding Chemistry Student and finally she was chosen for the Bryn Mawr Book Award.  It is awarded to a student who "demonstrates an intense intellectual commitment, a self-directed and purposeful vision of his/her life, and a desire to make a meaningful contribution to the world." Grandma and Papa came to watch and after we went for a fabulous dessert/celebration.  Congratulations Lucy!  We are so proud of you!! </div>
