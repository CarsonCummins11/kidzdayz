<div class="post_text">Carson made it on the state cross country team for his school this year - very exciting!  However, the race is the day after his birthday so no donuts for breakfast or birthday cake this year :).  He went to school followed by practice and a team dinner at an Italian Restaurant (gotta have the pasta!).  He came home in time to open some presents and go to bed.  Apparently kids at school and at practice sang "Happy Birthday" and we're doing his favorite meal on Sunday, so we'll call it good for this year:)</div>
