<div class="post_text">Carson has been excited about his first high school dance since, I think, 7th grade.  He's also been planning to ask his friend Lucy for about that long.  Well, he asked, she said yes!, and last night was the dance :)  He went with a group.  Originally it was 3 couples but then a few girls decided to join.  They met up at one of the boys' houses for dinner and pictures, then went to the dance.  After they all came here and watched a movie.  A very nice group of kids and from all the giggling we were hearing, I think they had a great time!</div>
