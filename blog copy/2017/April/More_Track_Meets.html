<div class="post_text">Track season continues!  Carson got picked to run in a varsity-only invitational on Friday night.  It was a blustery evening and his race was not until 8:30pm and an hour away from home.  We almost didn't go but decided at the last minute to make the trip.  It was very worth it!  Such a fabulous race to watch!!  He also had a normal meet on Wednesday night and ran the 800m as well as the 4x400.</div>
