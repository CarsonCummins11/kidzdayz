<div class="post_text">After what was a RIDICULOUSLY long and difficult process Lucy was accepted into 9 of the 11 schools she applied to.  Now she has finally committed to a school!  She will be going to the University of Richmond!  She was offered admittance as an Oldham Scholar.  This is a fabulous scholarship/program where she gets free tuition and room and board as well as a pretty hefty stipend to travel or do most anything she wants to do that is academically related!  We're all super excited while, at the same time, a bit anxious about the fact that she'll be a LONG ways from home!  So proud of her!!  Go Spiders!! :)</div>
