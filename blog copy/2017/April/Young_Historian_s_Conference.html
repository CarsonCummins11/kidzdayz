<div class="post_text">Lucy wrote a research paper for her History class at school.  Her teacher submitted it to a Young Historian's Conference.  The paper was selected to be presented at the conference.  She did the presentation on Thursday.  Andy & I went to watch.  It was so great watching her present and field questions after.  Very cool!</div>
