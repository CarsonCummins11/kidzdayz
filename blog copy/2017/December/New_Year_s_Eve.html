<div class="post_text">At 11am on New Year's Eve, Carson came in to ask me if he could have a NYE party at our house.  Normally I may have laughed at him if it weren't for the fact that he's been so sick for the past 9 days.  So we all rallied and threw together a party for Carson and his friends.  No photographic evidence because it's seriously not cool to have your mom taking pictures at said party but we had 10 kids over and they had a great time eating, listening to music, laughing and playing games.  In the meantime Andy, Lucy and I played games and then got dressed up and went for a short time to our neighbor's big party.  A lovely time had by all!</div>
