<div class="post_text">My poor Lucy... She was at school yesterday from 7am - 9pm.  After school yesterday they had the sleepover for the 5th grade girls they have in their science mentoring program.  She got to come home early because we had to leave the house at 6:30 this morning for the annual Science Bowl competition.  Well, she wasn't feeling great last night.  She then woke up around 2:30 with a fever and feeling really terrible.  After about 4 hours of sleep she got up to get ready and felt truly awful.  She finally threw up and was feeling a little bit better.  She had to be there or the team could not participate - they have no alternates.  She ended up doing spectacularly well!  She answered most of the questions for her team and they made it through to the final round - so very impressive!!  It was so funny to listen to the questions.  I honestly did not understand 90% of the words, worse yet the actual questions!  It was nutty.  I felt like I was in a Charlie Brown show and I was hearing the teacher... I just heard "wah wah wah wah..."  Totally cracked me up!  In the end I was almost glad when they finally lost so she could finally come home to rest!</div>
