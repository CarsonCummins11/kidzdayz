<h1 class="post_title">Another Snow Day Announced!!</h1>

<div class="post_text">Both kids schools just announced our 6th snow day of the year!!  At this rate Carson's school would have to go to almost July to make up the days.  A little worrisome since we just bought plane tickets to fly to Spain the day after Carson was scheduled to get out of school!  I'm starting to think Portland might have to break down and invest in snow removal equipment.  The kids are still thrilled though!  They went out for a long walk with Zoe as soon as it was announced.</div>
