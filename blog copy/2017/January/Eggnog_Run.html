<div class="post_text">Carson's team has an annual NYE tradition of an eggnog run.  They all run laps and after each lap they chug a cup of eggnog.  The person who makes the most laps is the winner.  It sounded like a great idea to Carson who is up for most things.  He proudly made it to only him and one other guy (a senior).  They ran 5 laps together before Carson could no longer gag down anymore eggnog.  He was fairly sick for the rest of the day and assures me that he will never do another eggnog run, and likely will never drink eggnog again!</div>
