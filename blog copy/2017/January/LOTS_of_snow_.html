<div class="post_text">The forecast was for 1-4 inches of snow.  It was closer to 10-12!  We got up this morning and decided it was a perfect day to XC ski from home.  What a fabulous treat!  We skied for a few hours and wound up at Starbucks for hot chocolate.  It was a spectacular way to start the day!  Later Carson went for his run (a little crazy with the amount of snow we had).  He wound up running into none other than his hero Mo Farah!  He could not have been more thrilled!!  They chatted for a few minutes - so exciting!  However, Carson didn't even think to ask him for a picture.  He regrets it greatly now :)</div>
