<div class="post_text">After Arcos it was time to move on to Seville.  On the way we decided to stop at one of Spain's many beach towns.  We didn't see this as a must-see for future visits but we did go to see a camera obscura which was pretty spectacular and had a little time on the beach.  Not a bad side-trip but not one we'd say is necessary to visit.</div>
