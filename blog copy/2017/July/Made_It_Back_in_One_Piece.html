<div class="post_text">A very dirty and smelly Carson made it back from his running camp Saturday night.  He came home with no real injuries (aside from seriously scraped up legs) and lots of stories about how fabulous it was!  I was worried this year because his team/all his friends go to another running camp this same week and I was afraid he'd feel like he was missing out.  No problem there!  He came home with lots of new friends and, once again, it was the greatest time ever! :-)</div>
