<div class="post_text">So fun to watch Carson's first high school track meet.  His coach had him run the 1500m and the 3000m.  That is a really tough double!!  The 3000m didn't even start until after it was entirely dark - long night for both of us!  He had great races getting new personal records in both races!  Nice way to start the season :)</div>
