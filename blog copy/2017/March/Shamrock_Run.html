<div class="post_text">Andy and Carson ran another Shamrock Run this year.  They did the 15K (9.3 miles).  It was a beautiful morning and they both had a great race.  There were more than 6500 runners in the race!  Carson came in 41st overall with a time of 57:35 (6:10/mile pace).  Not sure of Andy's place but he finished in 74 minutes - pretty speedy for the hilly and crowded course!  He had to be quick because he had to fly to Taiwan this afternoon.  We got home and he had 10 minutes to shower and get out the door to the airport.  Busy morning at our house!</div>
