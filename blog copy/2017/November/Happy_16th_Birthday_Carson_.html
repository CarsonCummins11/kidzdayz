<div class="post_text">Carson was supposed to be running at the state meet on his birthday.  However, his cast prevented that so he went down on the rooter bus for the day.  We started the day with a nice breakfast and gifts with a special guest :)  Lucy is terribly sick but managed to call for his birthday.  After the meet he went straight to a party - so overall a fun day for him.  On Sunday he went to dinner and to see a comedian with some friends and on Monday night we had a special birthday dinner.  I think 16 is in the books :)</div>
