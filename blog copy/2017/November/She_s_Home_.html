<div class="post_text">At long last!  Lucy counted and it was 88 days since she'd seen me and 96 since she'd been home or seen Carson.  That's a very long time!  Her flight landed at 12:50am but we were still a pretty excited welcoming party.  I wanted to make a welcome home sign but the boys weren't quite as into it as me.  Carson suggested we make a sign that said "Welcome Home from Rehab!  Stay Strong!"  He's a funny guy!  :) :)  So excited to have her home for a few days!</div>
