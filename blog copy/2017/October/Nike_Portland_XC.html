<div class="post_text">Great start and not-so-great finish to Carson's race on Saturday.  It was a big race with a LOT of guys.  It was also the fastest race of the day and a lot of pressure!  He did great up until about 400-600 meters to go.  Heading down a hill he got boxed in and  jostled by two other runners (not intentional).  He ended up coming down on the inside of his foot/ankle pretty hard. He managed to finish the race but not his usual speedy time.</div>
