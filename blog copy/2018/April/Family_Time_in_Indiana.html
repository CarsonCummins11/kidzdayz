<div class="post_text">Lucy and I met up in Terre Haute to attend a bridal shower for Lucy's cousin Ben's bride-to-be.  The whole family was there except for Andy and Carson.  We had so much fun playing with all the little great nieces and nephews and hanging out with everyone.  So happy we got to go :)</div>
