<div class="post_text">Our family vacation this year was a road trip to Colorado.  We spent the first week in Grand Lake, CO which is the town at the west entrance of Rocky Mountain National Park. The first day we were there (the day Lucy was flying into Denver from Santiago), Andy and Carson got up early to ride up Trailridge Road.  It's the highest elevation paved road in the US and goes all through the park.  They got their wires crossed about when and where they were meeting at the top.  Carson went much farther than the plan and they wound up getting back much later than planned which had me worried sick and calling RMNP emergency services.  We were also nearly an hour late picking up Lucy but all was well in the end.  They loved the ride and we were all thrilled to have Lucy back!!</div>
