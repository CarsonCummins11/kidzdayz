<div class="post_text">Carson's first track meet was last night!!  He hasn't run in a race since he got hurt October 6th.  To say he was excited would be a HUGE understatement!  He had a great race which was a very happy relief.  It looks like the time off did him some good :)  I absolutely love that we have several team parents who take professional quality pictures at every meet.  I had a tough time narrowing them down to the best ones :)</div>
