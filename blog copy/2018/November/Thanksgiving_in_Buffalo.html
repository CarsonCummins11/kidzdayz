<div class="post_text">When you're living all the way across the country, it's a pretty big commitment to come home for the few days of Thanksgiving break.  Lucy was thrilled to be invited to spend the break with Aunt Patsy and Uncle Jerry and their kids in Buffalo.  She had a great time.  One of the main highlights was she got to go to her first pro hockey game and learned a lot about the sport!  We were so grateful she was with family for the break and that she was so well entertained:)</div>
