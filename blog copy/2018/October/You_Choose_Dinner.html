<div class="post_text">Junior year is tough!  All the testing, the college prep, the hard class load.  Then add running on top of that and sometimes it's a LOT!  Carson had a particularly busy weekend so we took him to one of his favorite places for dinner.  Lucy wasn't with us so the had to show her how the boys were repping Richmond :)</div>
