<div class="post_text">I'm pretty sure this was Carson's first time backpacking without Andy and it sounds like it was spectacular!Â  They had to do some serious navigating for the first two miles as the trail had been ruined by fires but after that it sounds like it was smooth sailing and they had a really great time! I was happy to get the text when they were out of the woods and headed home :)</div>
