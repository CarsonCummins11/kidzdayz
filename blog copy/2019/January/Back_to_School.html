<div class="post_text">Break always goes WAY too fast!  I was very glad I was going back with Lucy this time to get her a car.  Prolonging the goodbye was good for me.  Had a great time in Richmond!  Got the car sorted then I got to meet Lucy's friends and have some fun meals out despite the snow.  And now she's back at it.  Not sure when she'll be home again but for now she's happy :)</div>
