<div class="post_text">I went to Boston for the 4th of July weekend to visit Lucy. We had such a fabulous time and it was so great to see her!! We toured her neighborhood and whole complex where she works. We went to museums, shopping, and many restaurants and bakeries. We walked to the Charles River to watch the 4th of July concert and fireworks. We also watched the World Cup and season 3 of Stranger Things.Â  So great to be able to hang out with her on her turf :)</div>
