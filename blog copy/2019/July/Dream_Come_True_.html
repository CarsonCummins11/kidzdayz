<div class="post_text">Lucy was so over-the-moon today! As part of her internship in Boston she is sitting in on a class on Global Public Health. Today they had a guest lecturer who just happened to be none other than Dr. Paul Farmer who is Lucy's idol!  She's read every book he's written and has followed his career closely for years. He is a huge voice in Global Public health, the founder of Partners In Health and the chair of the department of Global Public Health at Harvard. She says he is the nicest guy ever in person and she's basically reached her pinnacle now that she's met him!  Then next week she gets to go to Lima Peru to work in one of his TB clinics with the Dr. she's working with this summer. She is definitely living her best life right now!!</div>
