<div class="post_text">For the second year in a row, Andy & Carson went up to Mt. Hood to do a grind of a workout.  They each ride their bikes from Government Camp up the steep road to Timberline Lodge (approx 5-6 miles).  Last year they both rode it 3X.  This year Carson rode it twice and ran it once and Andy rode it 3x again.  Carson says it was one of his hardest workouts of the year - sounds like the run was brutal!!</div>
