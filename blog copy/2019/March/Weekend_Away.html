<div class="post_text">One of my Christmas gifts from Andy was a weekend away in Astoria.  We went last weekend and had a really great time!  We had beautiful weather, ate some good food, did a lot of hiking/walking, and learned a lot about a really cool place!  Astoria is where the Columbia River meets the Pacific Ocean in an area called the Graveyard of the Pacific.</div>
