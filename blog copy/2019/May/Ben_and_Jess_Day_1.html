<div class="post_text">We were so excited to host our nephew Ben and his new wife Jess! They were only here for 2 full days so we had to pack in a lot. They said they wanted to hike so that's what we did.  On the first day we went out to the gorge and hiked up Hamilton Mountain, had lunch in Hood River, and then as we drove up to Mt. Hood/Timberline we stopped for one more hike to a waterfall.  Lots of miles hiked and driven in one day, but it was beautiful out and we had a great time with them!</div>
