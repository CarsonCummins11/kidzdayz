<div class="post_text">On day 2 we headed to the beach. On the way we stopped and hiked Saddle Mountain.  It was a beautiful day but the ocean was socked in so the view wasn't quite as spectacular as it could have been.  Still a great day with a LOT of vertical hiking! After the hike we had lunch in Cannon Beach, walked around for a bit and then hustled home for Carson's Junior Prom</div>
