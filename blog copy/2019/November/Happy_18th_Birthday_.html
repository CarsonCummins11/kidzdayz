<div class="post_text">Can't believe he's 18! His birthday was on a Monday the week before the state meet so he didn't want to do much or to eat anything unhealthy... we'll be celebrating a little more after the meet! We just had birthday breakfast and dinner and gifts... A very happy birthday to our sweet boy!!!</div>
