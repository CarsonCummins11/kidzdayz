<div class="post_text">Sunset was ranked either 6th or 8th (depending on the source) in the state going into the race on Saturday. The boys knew they were much better than that, they just needed everyone to have a good day. And a good day they had! They came in third in the fastest group of teams that has ever raced the course. The course record which was held by one of the all time great Olympians was broken by 30 seconds! That is a HUGE amount of time in a 5k. It was an amazing day and so fun to watch! Very sad to be done but so proud of Carson and all the hard work he put into this sport and this team over the past 4 years!</div>
