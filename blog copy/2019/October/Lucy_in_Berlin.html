<div class="post_text">Lucy's on a trip this week with her "core course" group. They flew to Berlin where they did an "alternative" walking tour, ate in a revolving restaurant at the top of some tower, visited various medical facilities and got to tour around on their own a bit.  The really huge news from Lucy's perspective was that she got to go into an operating room where they were performing open heart surgery!  I assumed she meant that she was in an observation room or something, but no, she was right there at the poor woman's head while the surgeon used the bone saw and cracked the sternum and then saw the blood fly as they opened the chest cavity, etc.  The guy Lucy went in with had to leave the room as soon as the bone saw came out but Lucy was very proud that she made it through the whole thing.  She said the surgeon chatted to her the whole time and answered all of her questions.  I said, 1) So gross, I could NEVER do that! and 2) Glad I wasn't the one being operated on! Not really great that they had a random student in the OR... but for Lucy, a huge opportunity that she LOVED!!</div>
