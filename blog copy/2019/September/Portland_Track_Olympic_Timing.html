<div class="post_text">Sometimes it is very awesome to live in the same city as Nike World Headquarters, especially if you're a runner.  When Carson was in middle school he ran for the Bowerman Track Club and was coached by the Olympic runners who are sponsored by Nike which was exceptionally cool for him! Last night there was a 5K time trial at the Nike track where 4 Olympic hopefuls raced to qualify for the Olympic standard.  Andy & I went to watch and Carson went with a group of teammates. All 4 of the athletes hit the qualifying times, and it was a super exciting race to watch!  After, Carson got to meet, talk to, and take pictures with the athletes which was spectacular in itself but they also got invited to run the cool down with Mo Ahmed, the Canadian champion. He was truly over-the-moon!</div>
