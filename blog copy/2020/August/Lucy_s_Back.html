<div class="post_text">After an unfortunate knee injury sidelined Lucy from doing testing clinics in person she decided to come home for a quick visit. Unfortunately it was the same day we realized we needed to send Carson to NY early so he wouldn't have the potential of needing to quarantine for school.  They overlapped by 2 days.  Zoe was THRILLED to have both kids home at once :)😍</div>
