<div class="post_text">Up early to drive to Rochester. We got to campus where Carson had to go be tested for Covid before we could move him in. Then once he was cleared we were assigned a one hour slot to move him in.  It was a whirlwind but all done now.  Despite the appearances in the first picture, Carson was super excited to be moving in and starting on his journey!</div>
