<div class="post_text">The day after we got home was my birthday and I received the absolute BEST flower delivery every! Liz brought Weston over to deliver flowers and some desserts. No better bday surprise than that 😍.  I also got a delivery of flowers, cupcakes and ice cream from my pal Katrina and a pre-decorated water bottle from Lucy.  Andy and I decided to celebrate the next day thanks to a late arrival home the night before and me just needing a minute to adjust!</div>
