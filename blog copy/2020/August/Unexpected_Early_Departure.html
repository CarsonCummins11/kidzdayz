<div class="post_text">We were scheduled to fly to Rochester with Carson to move him into his dorm on Aug. 15th. Â On August 5th we learned that Oregon was dangerously close to being added to the list of states that had to quarantine upon arrival in NY. That was really a worst-case scenario for Carson so we scrambled and flew him out a week early to stay with Andy's sister Patsy, in Buffalo. Â We were so lucky we had that as an option and so grateful that Patsy and Jerry were willing to host Carson for a week! Â He wound up having a great time and, with a lot of help, getting everything organized for school drop off. Â Andy and I were able to fly out the following week to move him in but it was sad to have to rush around to get him packed and ship him off when Lucy was still home ðŸ˜”</div>
