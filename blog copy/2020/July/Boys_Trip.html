<div class="post_text">Carson was very excited for a big road trip this summer.  He planned a major backpacking excursion with a friend in CA and then a trip through southern Utah with his cousin.  However, with the pandemic upon us, everything kind of fell apart.  So, the back-up plan became a roadtrip to Flagstaff, AZ with dad to spend several weeks running at high elevation.  They left on Monday July 6 and made it there on Wednesday July 8 (our 25th anniversary) </div>
