<div class="post_text">Lucy's summer internship has changed. Her clinic was selected to be a Covid testing facility once/week.  So Lucy was put in charge of the logistics.  She was super busy getting everything organized.  Last Saturday was their second clinic and things are going very smoothly!  She is also in charge of calling everyone and giving results...  Below is a picture someone snapped of their outdoor testing set-up.  </div>
