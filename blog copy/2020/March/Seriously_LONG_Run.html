<div class="post_text">Carson is planning to run a 50K race in a few weeks. Today was his longest training run yet.  He ran 22 miles with us on bikes trying to keep up ;)  It was quite an effort!  We didn't get started until nearly 4pm so it was fully dark when we got done. Carson was whipped and we were all seriously muddy!!</div>
