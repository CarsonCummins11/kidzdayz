<div class="post_text">I have not gotten any pictures from Carson. So, was when he told me about a "prank" he and his roommate and friends from his floor were doing I asked for photo evidence. They filled a big box with plastic spoons and put it on a skateboard and did a little tour around campus for photo opps. Not 100% sure of the purpose but I'm guessing me "getting it" wasn't the idea ðŸ˜‚</div>
