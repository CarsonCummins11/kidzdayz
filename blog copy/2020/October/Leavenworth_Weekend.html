<h1 class="post_title">Leavenworth Weekend</h1>

<div class="post_text">We decided to spend a weekend away. We went to Leavenworth in central Washington. It's a Bavarian themed town set in an area called The Enchantments. We spent two days hiking. The first day was to Eight Mile Lake. There was a LOT of wind. We saw 4 big trees fall. It's SO loud - sounded like gunfire or fireworks. One of the trees fell right near us, we had to turn around and run back up the path or we'd likely have been flattened, Â It was nuts and had us both really freaked out! Then when we left there was a car in the middle of the forest road just down from the trailhead. A tree had fallen across the car as the woman was driving up to the trailhead. Luckily the driver was fine but the car was totaled! Definitely not a good day to be in the forest!</div>
