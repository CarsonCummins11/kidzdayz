<div class="post_text">On our way to a hiking adventure up in Washington we were driving on I5 very fast and had a major blowout. It was super scary and on a very busy section of the freeway! Very grateful for AAA, cell phones and proximity to a Les Schwab! 3.5 hours later we were on our way :)</div>
