<div class="post_text">My first destination was 5 nights at Red Mountain Resort. I've wanted to visit here for a long time and it has lived up to my expectations for sure! I wasn't even aware that it's right at the gate to Snow Canyon State Park which is a spectacular destination for hikers! I hiked every single day right from my room. It could not have been more perfect! I would hike every morning followed by some time in the pool before showering and eating in time to lay outside in a hammock and read for the evening. Â Now that is the way to live!</div>
