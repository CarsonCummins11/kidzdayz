<div class="post_text">We were planning to spend my birthday in Lake Tahoe with friends. However, the wildfires were way too bad for us to go down. So, we decided to hike from Timberline. Funny enough I've hiked all over Mt. Hood but had never started from Timberline. Unfortunately the weather wasn't great so we didn't have the optimal views but we had a beautiful hike and then drinks and dinner in the lodge. A near perfect day :)</div>
