<div class="post_text">Carson's girlfriend, Laura, came out from NY to visit. They were super adventurous and busy for the week. I think Carson did a great job of showing her all of the highlights. We loved having her here and were sorry to see her go. Looking forward to visiting UR soon to see them both :)</div>
