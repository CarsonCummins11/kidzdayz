<div class="post_text">Andy and Carson went down to Ashland in southern OR to do a 50K trail race. With more than 4,200 feet of elevation gain, it was hot, hilly and brutal! Carson was in first place for the first 20+ miles before going off course for a short time and then having a poorly timed "race" up a very long hill with another runner. At that point he "fell apart". He wound up 6th overall and first in his age group.  Andy came in 29th overall.  Both had a fantastic time and were VERY glad it was over!</div>
