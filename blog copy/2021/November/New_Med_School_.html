<div class="post_text">After an insanely long and difficult process, Lucy is now starting to hear back from medical schools where she's been accepted. So far, she's been accepted at University of Massachusetts and Brown University's Warren Alpert Medical School.  We have learned through following Lucy through this process that it is very definitely super difficult to get into med school. LOTS of hard work has gone into this acceptance! We couldn't be more proud of her! </div>
<div class="post_text">Lucy took a day trip to checkout Providence and Brown. It looks like it was a beautiful day and she loved Providence!</div>
