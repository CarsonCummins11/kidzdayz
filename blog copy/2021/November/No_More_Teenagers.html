<div class="post_text">Carson's 20!! How the heck did that happen?! His girlfriend, Laura and his roommate Charlie planned a surprise party for him. I supplied some cupcakes and they did everything else. Very sad not to be there for his bday but it was so nice to see the community he's built and the fun friends he has in Rochester!
The person who made the cupcakes delivered them to Laura :)</div>
