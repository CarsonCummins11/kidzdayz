<div class="post_text">Lucy received another award from school. It is the Service for Change award. She decided not to drive back to Richmond for the ceremony so her boss from her job at Health Brigade went in her place and accepted the award for her :) She had an impact on a lot of people in Richmond and it makes me so happy to see evidence of that and to see her getting recognition for all of her hard work!Â </div>
