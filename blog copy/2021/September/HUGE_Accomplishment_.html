<div class="post_text">Carson has, for a very long time, wanted to focus on running "ultras" (races that are longer distances than marathons). He really wants to focus on 100+ mile trail races. Â Well, last weekend he did his first 50 mile run. Â He went 25 miles out the Erie Canal trail and then back. His friend Seth rode a bike beside him the whole way and other friends met them here and there along the way. At the end he had a whole group there to cheer him on ðŸ˜ƒ We were sad not to be there but were able to follow along on a GPS app he sent us. Â You'll have to excuse some of the language on the pictures his friends shared ðŸ˜‚ Â So proud of him!!
