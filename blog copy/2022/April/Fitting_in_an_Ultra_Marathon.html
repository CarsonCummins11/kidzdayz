<div class="post_text">Carson is taking five classes and spending tons of time working on a business he's building. But, just to keep things interesting, he also signed up to run a 50k in rural PA with his buddy Seth. Â So grateful Laura was there to take a few pics for me. Â Carson apparently had a great race for the first twenty plus miles before he got lost and ran an extra two miles - some of them through streams. When he got to the aid station around mile 28 he sat down and the volunteers at the station realized he was not well. It turns out he managed to get hypothermia and was very out of it. He was bundled into a car and taken to the finish line. With the extra miles he ran when he was lost, he definitely finished the 50k ðŸ˜œ Very grateful there were people there to help him!</div>
