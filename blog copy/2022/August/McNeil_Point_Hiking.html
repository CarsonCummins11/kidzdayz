<div class="post_text">This hike on Mt. Hood has been on my bucket list for a long time. It did not disappoint despite the fact that we got a bit lost and did a stretch straight up the mountain that was not part of the trail. Andy took the day off on Friday and we got to miss the crowds. Beautiful day!</div>
