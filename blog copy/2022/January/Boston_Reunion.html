<div class="post_text">Carson and Laura went to Boston for the weekend. Laura to visit her sister and Carson to visit his :)  Sounds like they all had a great time! So happy they got to see each other. Carson heads back to in-person classes next week so glad they had time together while they had a chance!  Pictures are from a trip to the science museum.</div>
