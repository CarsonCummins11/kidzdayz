<div class="post_text">Finally had a beautiful day on Mt. Hood. Andy drove up with the kids and dropped them at SkiBowl to ski while he went 11 miles away to cross country ski. Everyone had a beautiful day! Then... it took Andy 5 hours to drive the 11 miles back to Ski Bowl to pick up the kids! Luckily the lodge was open for night skiing so they were able to stay warm and have food, but what a debacle!! We still don't know what caused the massive traffic jam.</div>
