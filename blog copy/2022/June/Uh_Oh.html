<div class="post_text">Andy flew down to visit Carson so they could go to the Western States Ultra Marathon. When he arrived Carson was at the airport waiting for him, but.... They wound up having to rent a car because the car was seriously broken down. It took a full week and a LOT of money to fix, but he's back in business.</div>
