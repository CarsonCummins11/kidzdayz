<div class="post_text">Carson is spending the summer in San Francisco doing an internship. He finished classes and had a week before he needed to be there so that's all the time we had with him home this summer. He got home just before Mother's Day :) He and I did a hike (me)/Run (him) together in the gorge and had a few dinners and a little hang out time. It was so great to have him home!
