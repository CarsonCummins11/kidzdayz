<div class="post_text">Carson's plans for fall break got messed up at the last minute so he decided he'd do a bit of a crazy hike. He packed up his backpack and started from his house and walked along the Eerie Canal Trail all the way to Letchworth, a mere 40 miles in one day. He spent a super miserable night there freezing in his tent and called a friend to pick him up the next day - not super excited to walk all the way back. Just another adventure for him ðŸ˜‚</div>
