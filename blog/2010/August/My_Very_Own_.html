<div class="post_text">Carson worked about 14 hours at my sister's house at the Street of Dreams and made nearly $70.  With that he was finally able to afford his very own unicycle.  Andy took him to a cool shop on the East side of town that is called something like "Serious Juggler's".  He was so thrilled with himself he couldn't stand it!  He's been riding it constantly since he got it.  He's VERY proud of the fact that he got it with his own money.  He told me "you know it means a lot more when you buy it for yourself".  Yesterday it got the first scratch and I really had to work to have him not cry about it.  I'm definitely seeing him buying his own car in the future.  He takes MUCH better care of things he buys himself!</div>
