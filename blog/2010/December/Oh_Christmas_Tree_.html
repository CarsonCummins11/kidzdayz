<div class="post_text">Guess what... Andy's out of town and we had another little problem...  The Christmas tree fell over and spilled about a gallon of water all over the floor along with LOADS of glass from all the ornaments that broke.  It was quite the comedy, Lucy and I putting the tree back up and trying to figure out how to keep it there without a functional stand... Who knew how heavy a Chritmas tree could be?</div>
