<div class="post_text">Thanksgiving was such a relaxing day this year.  That could be because I did no cooking and really no cleaning.  Lucy and Haylie went down to Grandma's early to help do the cooking so when we showed up dinner was done.  Then Andy helped with the clean up so I figured my family was covered so I hung out in front of the fire chatting with Jamie :)  We had a great meal and a lot of good family time.  Thanks Mom!</div>
