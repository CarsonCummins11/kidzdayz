<div class="post_text">Well, Andy's off on another Asian adventure.  This time he's in Taiwan.  He left early Sunday morning.  So... to keep us all busy we met up with some friends whose dad also happens to be in Asia.  We went bowling then out for frozen yogurt.  For the record, I am a REALLY bad bowler!!</div>
