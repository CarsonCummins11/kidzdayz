<div class="post_text">Last night was our last Dog Agility class of this session.  The jury's out on whether we'll do it again or not.  Zoe didn't quite graduate to the next class because she developed a sudden and extreme fear of the dog walk.  It's a 12 inch wide plank that is 5 feet off the ground.  The dog is supposed to run up a ramp, go across the dog walk, then down the other side on a ramp.  She's done it many times before but once her back paw slipped off and then she was all done.  Lucy was a little sad but Zoe was not the only dog who didn't "pass", so we were OK.</div>
