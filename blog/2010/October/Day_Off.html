<div class="post_text">We had the day off school on Monday and Tuesday of this week.  So yesterday the kids and I headed to OMSI.  Lucy was dying to see this exhibit on identity.  It was extremely cool!  There were all these computer simulations which took your picture and then would show you how you'd look as an old person, an old person who smoked, or who didn't wear sunscreen, etc.  There was also one which took your picture then you could choose to make yourself a different gender and/or a different ethnicity.  We had a great time with that one.</div>
