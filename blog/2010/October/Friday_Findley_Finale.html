<div class="post_text">Each week at Carson's school the 3rd grade classes take turns doing a weekly news show.  This week was Carson's class' turn.  Carson was the US News reporter.  He had to find a US News article and re-write it in his own words then present it to the whole 3rd grade and a bunch of parents.  It's very cute and he did a great job!</div>
