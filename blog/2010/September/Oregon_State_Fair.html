<div class="post_text">Yesterday we went to the Oregon State Fair in Salem.  My kids had never been to a fair so I decided it was time.  We took Lucy's buddy Molly with us.  We were there 8.5 hours and did a LOT!  We completely lost Carson not once but twice.  That kid can drive me crazy with his wandering off.  After the first scare we set a meeting place and when I couldn't find him the second time I finally ran there and he was casually sitting on the ground waiting for me.</div>
