<div class="post_text">Andy is in China.  In fact Andy is basically traveling the whole month of September.  So... of course, now is a good time for a flood, right?  This morning I walked out the door to take Carson to school.  As soon as I went around the corner and could see the garage I saw a river flowing from under the garage door.  I used the outdoor keypad and opened the big garage door and truly the garage had flooded.  The hot water heater was gushing VERY large quantities of water into the garage and had been for quite some time.</div>

<div class="post_text">So... I ran to the corner where the other mom's were waiting to walk the kids to school.  One mom said she'd take Carson to school.  Another mom ran into her house and got her husband who was, thankfully, still home (and NOT in China!) and came over and got the water turned off and the gas turned off to the water heater.  A third mom showed up at my house about 20 minutes later with a pair of rubber boots and a mop ready to help clean up the mess.  I love my neighborhood :)</div>

<div class="post_text">So... all plans for the day were cancelled (except my hair appointment - you know how that is...) and I spent the morning cleaning up the flood waters, researching hot water heaters, and talking with the people in my life who always help me in a crisis.  I called Jamie (my sister who is the builder), and my friend Charles.  Between them I got advice on the flood and the clean-up, good hot water heaters, good plumbers, and a bit of sympathy.  So we are now the proud owners of a new water heater and a VERY clean garage floor :)</div>
