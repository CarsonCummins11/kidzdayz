<div class="post_text">Carson is in a soccer tournament this weekend.  He had 2 games today.  This afternoon he played goalie.  About the middle of the second half he took a ball to the face.  It was kicked so hard that it hit him and knocked him up off his feet.  Below is about 15 minutes after he was carried off the field.  His goalie penny took a majority of the blood - so this is only about 1/4 of it.  He seems fine now.  Shortly after the hit he was telling me things looked fuzzy and that I was flashing in and out of his vision.  It was a little scary.  On the sidelines he just kept saying "did it go in?"  He wanted to know if the ball he took in the face went in the goal.  It did not. :)</div>
