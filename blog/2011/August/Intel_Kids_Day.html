<div class="post_text">On Thursday the kids went to Intel Kids Day with Andy.  It seems to get cooler every year.  It's a whole day of really cool activities.  They did "boat float" experiments, chemistry projects, saw OMSI presentations, Mad Science presentations, made bird feeders, etc, etc.  They loved it!  The best part was having lunch in the Intel cafeteria -their favorite place in Portland to eat :)  And... this meant a whole day alone for me :)</div>
