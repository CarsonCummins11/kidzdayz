<div class="post_text">Andy and I went for a bike ride together this afternoon.  We left the kids with a few chores to do.  We were only gone a little over an hour.  We came back and they completely surprised us.  Lucy met us at the door in her nice clothes.  She asked us not to look and to just go upstairs and put on nice clothes.  We were all sweaty but complied all the same.  We came down to find that they were both dressed up, had set the table with wine glasses (filled with water), place mats and linen napkins, candles and place cards.  There was a menu (but it was fixed - no choices) and they'd made us dinner which they had staged in the dining room.  They kept going back and forth from the dining room with trays serving us first a salad, then pasta with sauce and finally ice cream for dessert.  They called their "restaurant" J'Adore.  It was all very sweet.  We need to leave them alone more often :)</div>
