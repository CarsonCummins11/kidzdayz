<div class="post_text">This years summer adventure for Andy is a 4 night, 5 day backpack trip in the mountains of Central Washington.  He's going with 5 buddies.  The packing is an amazing ordeal.  I guess it makes sense when you think they're hiking 10+ miles per day with everything on their backs.  This is one I'm happy to miss out on :)</div>
