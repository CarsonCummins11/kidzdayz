<div class="post_text">Lucy has just gone through her first middle school science fair.  She did an experiment on phytoplankton and its best habitat.  She worked with a partner and had no involvement from mom, so this was the best science fair yet!!  Actually, they really did well and were selected to represent Stoller at the NW Science Expo in March.  Way to go Lucy!!</div>
