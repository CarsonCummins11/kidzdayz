<div class="post_text">My friend Heather and I really want our kids to start learning to cook.  We also want to see more of one another.  So... we decided to start a monthly family dinner.  She has a boy Carson's age and a girl Lucy's age.  This month the boys were in charge.  Next month it will be the girls' turn.  The kids decide on the menu, make a list of ingredients needed and do the cooking (with adult supervision).  Whoever is not cooking does the table-setting and the clean up.  Tonight the boys chose to make homemade pizzas, salad and fruit kababs with marshmallows and chocolate sauce for desert.  I was shocked at how seriously they took it.  The really did mostly all the work themselves and were VERY proud of the end result.</div>
