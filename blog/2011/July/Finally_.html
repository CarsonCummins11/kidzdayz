<div class="post_text">Carson has been saving all his money for almost a year now for an iPod Touch.  He just made it as of last night.  He went this morning with Andy and bought it with all his crumpled up dollar bills :)  He couldn't be more thrilled!  The only problem is we're leaving this afternoon to go camping and he won't be taking it with him...</div>
