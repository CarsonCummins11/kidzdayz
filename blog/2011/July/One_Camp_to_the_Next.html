<div class="post_text">Carson came home from Foster Lake 2 days early for a soccer tournament.  Lucy, on the other hand, got home around 7pm.  This morning we all got up early for Carson's soccer game then rushed home to re-pack so the kids could head off to Camp Westwind.  They each went individually last year (Carson went to "first timers" camp).  This year they're off together.  They're gone for 5 nights!!  They were so excited.  It's very strange and quiet to have them gone, but yesterday afternoon Andy and I went for a very long bike ride together - guilt free - then went to a movie.  We're definitely going to take advantage of our time!</div>
