<div class="post_text">Lucy's birthday celebrations went on for days!  We were in Terre Haute for the actual day.  We started the morning out with Lucy getting her gift from us - a cell phone.  Very exciting.  That evening Aunt Mary (the mother of the bride who was a little crazy with wedding plans), very kindly hosted a lovely party at her house.  We had pizza and cake for about 30 people.  It was a LOT of fun.  Aunt Mary definitely gets the award for the very best hostess EVER!  Some day I want to be like her!  Thanks for everything Mary!</div>
