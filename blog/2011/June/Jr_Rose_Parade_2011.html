<div class="post_text">A big contingent of Findley unicycle riders in the Jr. Rose Parade this year!  Carson was so excited about this event.  He starts a countdown months in advance.  There are tons of people lining the street and a 4 lane road for them to perform all their awesome unicycle tricks!  Findley took home the first place ribbon this year.  I'm guessing that's best unicycle club but I didn't pay that much attention:)  He had a blast one way or another.</div>
