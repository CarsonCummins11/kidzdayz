<div class="post_text">Kids had a fabulous time tonight!  Started out with dinner with friends.  They went out trick-or-treating with a friend each.  Lucy ended up hooking up with a big group and left the dads and little brothers behind.  Carson won my award for best costume!  He saw this idea in a book and created the whole thing completely on his own!  He's supposed to be carrying his head around in his hands :)  Lucy was a princess - and a very lovely one at that :)</div>
