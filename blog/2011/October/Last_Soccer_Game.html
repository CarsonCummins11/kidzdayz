<div class="post_text">Today was the last game of the fall season for Carson... well, that is, until the big tournament in 2 weeks and until the Futsal season starts... really soccer never ends for Carson these days.  But, today was the last game for the moment and it was fantastic!  They were down 0-3 early in the game and came back to win 5-4.  It was a nail-biter and super fun to watch! </div>
