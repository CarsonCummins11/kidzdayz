<div class="post_text">Lucy is in her school Musical this year.  She's part of the ensemble - a caterpillar and a duke.  She has been rehearsing almost every day for the past few months.  Finally we're entering the home stretch.  Tonight was the final dress rehearsal and I was in charge of supervising the "green room".  They also did pictures at the end of the rehearsal.</div>
