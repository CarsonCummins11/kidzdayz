<div class="post_text">We went this afternoon and saw a really fabulous production of "Twelfth Night" at Washington Park.  I was worried that the kids wouldn't follow but they both loved it.  It didn't hurt that the show was so funny and well done.  I highly recommend it for any Portland friends.  It's showing for a few more weeks.</div>
