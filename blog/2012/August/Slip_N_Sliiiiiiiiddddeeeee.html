<div class="post_text">Last week Andy's group at Intel had a family picnic.  It was surprisingly great!  We had a lot of fun!  The biggest draw was a 350 foot slip 'n slide!  It was awesome!!  They also had Radio Disney there and the kids won lots of prizes doing various things with them.  The best prize was 4 tickets to the Wings & Waves water park!!  We're all very excited :)</div>
