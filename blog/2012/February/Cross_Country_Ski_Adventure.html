<div class="post_text">On Sunday we decided to head up for a cross country ski day.  We decided to try a new trail.  We looked in our books and found a 6 mile loop.  Should be no problem... maybe a few hours.... Well, we didn't realize that the loop itself was 6 miles and they weren't counting the getting to the loop and getting back.  Nor did we account for the fact that a majority of the trail was all snowed over with no tracks.  Andy and I broke trail and the kids followed in our tracks for 10 miles and 4.5 hours.  The kids were such troopers.  At some points I got in behind Andy so I wouldn't have to break the trail.  It was an adventure to say the very least!  We were all exhausted!!</div>
