<div class="post_text">Tonight Lucy and I went to hear FW de Klerk speak.  He's the former President of South Africa who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 with Nelson Mandela for their efforts to end apartheid.  He is a truly amazing and inspirational man and the speach was truly FANTASTIC!!  The conversation on the way home was even better.  Nothing like hearing your 12 year old getting all up in arms about world politics and global warming :)</div>
