<div class="post_text">On Thursday we spent the day in Kona where we all took surf lessons.  It was SUCH a blast.  I will say, however, that it's a little harder than it looks!  The instructors kept telling me things like "you've got to feel it..."  I'm not there yet but had some pretty good rides!  Andy and Carson were die-hards - out for a LONG time!</div>
