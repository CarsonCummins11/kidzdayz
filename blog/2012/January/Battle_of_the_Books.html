<div class="post_text">It's Battle of the Books time again.  This year I was thrilled to learn that Carson and his team named themselves "The Midevil Lame-O's" ... nice.  They have made it out of the preliminary round of something close to 55 teams down to the final 16.  We'll see how the next round goes.</div>
