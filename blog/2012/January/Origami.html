<div class="post_text">Carson has a tendancy to get very obsessed with things.  His latest obsession is Origami.  He is constantly folding anything he can get his hands on.  He's actually quite good at it and has come up with some very impressive creations.  Today he came to me with a small bird which, when you pull it's tail, flaps it's wings.  Very cool!</div>
