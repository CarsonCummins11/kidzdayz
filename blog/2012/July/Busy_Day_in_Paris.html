<h1 class="post_title">Busy Day in Paris</h1>
<h2 class="post_date">Monday, July 2, 2012</h2>
<div class="post">
<div class="post_text">We started the day being a bit lazy at our apatment.  Everyone is a bit tired at the moment!  Carson is having a serious problem with pain in one of his heels.  The big problem is the fact that just resting it is a little tough right now given that we're walking miles and miles every day.  We stopped at a pharmacy today and bought some gel pads for his shoes and that seems to be helping.  Lucy has developed a nagging cough.  We're really hoping this all just passes!!</div>

<div class="post_text">Once we got going, we made up for our slow start.  We started the day walking through a great district of Paris called the Marais which is between our apartment and Notre Dame Cathedral.  Our first real stop was a tour of the cathedral.  It was a Sunday so they were having a mass but we were able to go in and look around all the same.  It's a stunning place with an amazing history.  To think of all that has happened since it was built and to see how beautiful it still is was pretty awe-inspiring.  After Notre Dame we grabbed some lunch and ate on the bank of the River Seine followed by ice cream from the very famous Berthillon.  After that we got on a Hop On Hop Off bus tour which took us all over Paris for a glimpse and a quick history of the main sites.  We got off at the Trocadero near the Eiffel Tower to get our first up-close glimpse before heading back to the apartment.</div>

<div class="post_text">In the evening we were exceptionally lucky to have been invited to have dinner with a family living here in Paris.  A friend of mine in Portland is from here and she very graciously asked her sister to host us.  We were a bit nervous not knowing what to expect but had the most lovely evening of our trip by far!  The kids had a great time with their kids and we all laughed a lot all night.  We stayed way too late given that they had to work and go to school the next day!  It stays light here until well after 10pm at the moment so we're having a hard having any kind of reasonable bed time!  What a memorable day for all of us today!!</div>
