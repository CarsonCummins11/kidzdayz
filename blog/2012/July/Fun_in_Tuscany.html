<h1 class="post_title">Fun in Tuscany</h1>
<h2 class="post_date">Sunday, July 22, 2012</h2>
<div class="post">
<div class="post_text">Our last two days in Tuscany have been spent simply hanging out, relaxing and generally having a great time with our new buddies!  On Saturday the kids decided to go off exploring.  They hiked about a mile down the hill where we're staying (an old dirt road) to a river and had a pic-nic.  Carson was thrilled to have taken his new swiss army knife - just in case, you know!  While they were gone all the adults generally lounged by the pool chatting and reading.  Once they were back we all swam for a while then had a quick dinner.  After dinner Andy got a lesson in making crepes from our new buddy Martin who is a chef and a food science professor in Dublin.  We were all thrilled to sample his practice run :)</div>

<div class="post_text">At about 10pm we headed into the small local town called San Donato to a local festival they were having.  We'd been told there would be music so we decided to check it out.  It couldn't have been more fantastic!!  The leader of the band was the most flamboyant older guy who was singing '50's rock music.  He was wearing fuscia pants and a very bright sequined jacket lined in fuscia - all tied together with leopard skin shoes!  Gotta love the fashion sense here!  We walked up and he was singing 'Blue Suede Shoes' by Elvis.  It was just so funny sitting in the midst of a fairly remote village in Italy (we were definitely the only tourists there) and listening to a band play American rock from the 50's and 60's.  The kids were excited but a little shy to start.  It took all of two songs before they were dancing every song.  Carson and Sadheh (oddly pronounced Sive) worked all night on their moves.  They were great together.  Actually the same went for Lucy and Aoife (pronounced Eefa).  It only took a few more songs before the adults were out there as well.  We all danced for several hours and had a blast!  What a very fun but odd way to spend a night in Italy :)</div>

<div class="post_text">Then on Sunday we had another day of R&R.  As you can imagine we're sleeping in a bit after our 1 and 2am bedtimes.  Once we were up Andy and I went for a run, came back and did some laundry and then sat by the pool reading for several hours while the kids worked on dance routines with their buddies.  They eventually informed us that there was to be an evening "dance-off".  We didn't think much of it but when we saw that the kids spent the better part of the day practicing their dance we decided to put something together.  The adults threw a YMCA dance together at the last minute.  The kids did a dance to Elvis' 'Hound Dog'.  It was so great!  We were so surprised at what a great job they'd done choreographing!</div>

<div class="post_text">After our dance-off, we shared a meal for our last night here and then spent the evening chatting.  Now here it is 12:30am and, once again, we're just getting to bed.  Tomorrow we're leaving here to spend a few nights in Florence.  We're all so sorry to leave!!  We've got a few days in Florence then 5 days in Rome and then we're headed home via Amsterdam.  I cannot believe how quickly the time has flown!!!  We are, by no means, ready to go home!</div>
