<div class="post_text">So much to see and do in Rome.  The history here is truly amazing.  We spent the morning on Friday on a tour of the Colosseum, the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill.  The Colosseum was finished in 82AD.  We were lucky in that they have just recently opened the bottom or lower level.  This is where all the wild animals were kept before being sent up (in an ingenious system of elevators).  They only let a few groups down a week and we were lucky enough to get to go down.</div>

<div class="post_text">The stories at the Colosseum had us all fascinated!  The "entertainment" would go on for around 100 days and in that time more than 5000 animals and 1000 gladiators would be killed.  However, of the level 1 (or the top) gladiators, only about 25 were killed in all the time they were doing the games.</div>

<div class="post_text">The level of sophistication shown in the planning of the town, the water system, the government, etc. are all just fascinating.  Despite a very hot day we all thoroughly enjoyed this tour!</div>

<div class="post_text">On Satuday we got up early and were picked up by a driver for a trip to Pompeii and Sorrento on the Amalfi coast.  The town of Pompeii had more than 25,000 people living in it and was, again, amazingly sophisticated in it's architecture and infrastructure.  Mt. Vesuvius is only 6 miles away so when the volcano erupted - between 11am and 1pm - no one had any chance of escaping.  No one knows how many people died.  It's pretty impactful to see people preserved in exactly the position in which they were found.  It's very sad.</div>

<div class="post_text">After Pompeii we went on to Sorrento which is only about 20 minutes away along the Amalfi coast.  It is such a beautiful area!  We had lunch, did some shopping around and checked out the shoreline.  It was a lovely way to spend the afternoon.  On the way back to Rome (a 3.5 hour drive) our van got a serious flat tire.  Our driver had limp the car to a pull-out on the highway and then get out and fix the tire in the serious heat.  Andy got out to offer assistance but he mostly offered moral support :)  Our luck with cars in Italy is not the best! </div>

<div class="post_text">Tonight is our last in Rome.  We are going to go out for a last nice dinner and then pack up and get ready for a quick afternoon in Amsterdam tomorrow and a long flight home on Tuesday.  We can't belive how quickly the time has flown by!  What an adventure!</div>
