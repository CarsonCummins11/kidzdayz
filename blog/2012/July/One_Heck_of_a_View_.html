<div class="post_text">Our last day in Paris.  Again, it's been a whirlwind.  We're all excited to sit on a train today on our way to Switzerland.  We'll have 4 straight hours to just read our books :)</div>

<div class="post_text">For our grand finale, we spent the morning touring the Paris Catacombs.  That's where, in the late 1700's, when Paris was growing rapidly and having a real problem with all the dead bodies that had been buried there - and I mean a real problem... I won't share the details we learned as it was disgusting, but let's just say things were oozing... - a man in Paris had the clever idea of filling the holes that had been created by mining the limestone to build all the cool buildings with all the bones from the cemeteries.  It's quite cool and quite creepy all at one time.  They were very neat and tidy in how they did it, and quite macabre with the fact that they made designs in lots of places.</div>

<div class="post_text">After our somewhat strange morning, we split up.  The boys went to Les Invalides, the war museum which sounds like it was pretty fantastic.  After their tour through the museum, they played soccer on a grass field in front of the museum... I guess bringing the soccer ball wasn't as bad of an idea as I'd thought :)  Lucy and I spent he afternoon shopping in all the cool places we'd heard about.  We were able to round out her "paris outfit".  A very fun way to end our time in Paris.</div>
