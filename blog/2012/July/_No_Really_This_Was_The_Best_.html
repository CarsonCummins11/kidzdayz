<div class="post_text">If we were trying to top yesterdays ropes course experience, I think we found it!  We decided to try paragliding today.  It was another beautiful day and we just did it.  I really can't explain how utterly unbelievable the experience was for all of us.  We took a tram and then walked to our take-off point.  The pilots took a little time getting the chutes and us ready and then we were off.  Carson went first - made me quite nervous but I really didn't get to choose. </div>

<div class="post_text">You're strapped to the pilot, he waits for the right wind conditions, you start walking downhill then running and within 5-10 seconds you're literally flying.  My pilot described it as "as close as you can get to feeling like a bird".  He was right and, as stated, it was truly awesome!!</div>
<div class="post_text">

<div class="post_text">The flight itself takes about 15 minutes.  We did roller-coaster-type dips and turns, flew right up next to giant waterfalls, dropped down to almost touching the tops of trees, and watched the birds as we flew above them.  What else is there to say?!?</div>
<div class="post_text">

<div class="post_text">When we'd landed the kids ran to Andy and I asking "can we do it again??"  Then when we were having our hot chocolate Carson said "OK, now really that was the best so far!"</div>
