<div class="post_text">For Christmas we got Lucy and Carson a knitting lesson.  We finally did it today and they're both hooked!  I couldn't believe it when I showed up and they were actually knitting.  They both love it and have spent a good part of today working on it.  I LOVE that Carson sits knitting with his tongue out.  My Grandma Ratliff, who taught me to crochet and many other things, used to always have her tongue out when she worked as well.  It makes me smile to see him like that.</div>
