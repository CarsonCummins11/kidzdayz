<div class="post_text">Last week I went away to a workshop for 5 days!!!  I went with a girlfriend to a beautiful place on Orcas Island, in the San Juan Islands off the coast of Seattle.  We stayed at a place called Indralaya.  Had a FABULOUS time!!  Andy had the kids for the first 3 days then we were helped out by my sister and, once again, our fabulous Elizabeth.  They all survived without me :)</div>
