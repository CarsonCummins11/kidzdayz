<div class="post_text">Andy & I spent the weekend in Bend where Andy competed in the Pole Pedal Paddle race for the first time.  It's a very fun event where you start by running a ways up the mountain, downhill skiing down, transition to cross country skis - ski 5 miles then transition to the bike - ride 22 miles, transition to running - run 5 miles, then transition to a kayak - paddle ~2 miles and then sprint 1/2 mile to the finish line.  Most people do it in teams, but Andy couldn't talk his wife into participating so he did it on his own.  I was the mandatory 2 person support crew.  It was actually really fun!  Best of all was a fun grown-ups-only weekend in Bend.  Grandma and Papa kept the kids and we had a great time!  Next year we're thinking the 4 of us will do it as a family team :)</div>
