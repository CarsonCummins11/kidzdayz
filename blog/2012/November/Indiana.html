<div class="post_text">We had a 4 day weekend off school so Andy and Lucy went to Indiana to visit Andy's family.  They had a great time seeing everyone and got to go to an IU football game where Andy was able to show Lucy around campus.  They both had a great time!  Oddly, no pictures with family but they did, indeed, have a great time visiting grandparents, aunts & uncles and cousins.</div>
