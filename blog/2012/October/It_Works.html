<div class="post_text">Last night when I went in to tell Carson it was time to go to sleep he was working in his "invention notebook".  I turned the lights out and lay in bed with him.  He said "I'm going to have a hard time going to sleep because I'm so excited!"  I asked why.  He said "well, I just created a hard drive for my nanobot and it really works.... well, in my head it works .... and on paper it works - so I'm pretty sure it'll work"</div>
