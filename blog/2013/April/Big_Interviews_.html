<div class="post_text">Carson's class was assigned to do a newspaper-type article that is going to be submitted for a contest for publishing in the National Geographic Kids magazine.  He decided he wanted to research how supercomputers are used to help predict storms and weather.  So... Andy got in touch with someone he knows at the super computing division at Intel.  That person connected Carson with two men at the University of Oklahoma.  Both are world renowned in their fields.  One started a program called CAPS (Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms) so our focus with him was fully on weather forecasting.  The second was with a man who is in charge of super computing for the university and for a nationwide program. Both were fascinating and Carson definitely got better with the second one.  He interviewed each for about 45 minutes so it was a pretty big endeavor for a first experience with interviewing :)</div>
