<div class="post_text">Here we go again!  Carson decided to do his science fair project on different types of "green" insulation.  He's testing things that can be found around the house and are often put in the trash or recycled.  He's doing shredded newspaper, plastic bags and vacuum debris, foam and cotton.  He got some help from Papa in building the "house" to test.  He stuffs the sides and ceiling with an insulator then uses a light bulb to heat it to a balmy 80 degrees.  Then he checks the temperature every 5 minutes to see how quickly it cools.  It's a pretty cool project!</div>
