<div class="post_text">I hadn't even taken the time to take a picture of our beautifully decorated tree before the *&%& thing fell down!  Many broken ornaments, lots of water and pine needles everywhere this morning!  It's currently leaning against the wall in a corner.  Not sure we're going to fix it :)</div>
