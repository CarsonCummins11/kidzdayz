<div class="post_text">It's been time for bark dust for the past 2 years.  Andy finally decided to bite the bullet and do it.  "It'll be a good work-out" is how he spun it to himself.  Carson was his happy and surprisingly willing helper.  They were out there well past dark 3 nights in a row.  It all looks great now :)</div>
