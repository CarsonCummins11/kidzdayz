<div class="post_text">Saturday was a BEAUTIFUL day in Portland.  Andy & Lucy took advantage and headed up to the mountain for a last day of cross country skiing.  Carson is in the midst of a programming class on Saturday mornings so we stayed home.  After his class we walked around downtown and had lunch.  A very fun day for all of us :)</div>
