<div class="post_text">On our last full day in Vegas we went for a fantastic hike back in the Red Rock area in the morning.  We got a bit lost at first but managed to find our way and had a great time!  We spent a few hours lounging by the pool in the afternoon just to finish off the time with some lazy time :)  Overall a fantastic trip!</div>
