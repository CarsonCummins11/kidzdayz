<div class="post_text">Carson has been taking a hip hop dance class again this year.  He's in a teen class where he is not only the youngest, but also the only boy.  When I realized this and asked him what he thought about it (there were some other boys who eventually dropped out).  He said "I view it as unlimited solo potential".  Gotta love the confidence there :)  Not sure if the video will work but this is a short video I took at parent viewing night this week.</div>
