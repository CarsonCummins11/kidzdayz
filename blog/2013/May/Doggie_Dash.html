<div class="post_text">Long ago Andy and I used to do the Doggie Dash with our Basset Hound, Charlie.  We've now passed the baton to the kids.  Carson ran on his own (Zoe's not quite his speed), and Lucy ran with Zoe (who was a bit distracted).  They both did great and had a lot of fun.  There were 3000 entrants which means we saw dogs of all breeds - very fun :)</div>
