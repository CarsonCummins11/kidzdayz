<div class="post_text">Carson's teacher entered the whole class in a Human Rights essay contest.  Carson wrote a piece on Cyrus the Great, the second king of Persia (who was apparently the first leader to prioritize human rights).  Out of 85 entrants his essay was chosen for first place.  So, last night we went to Beaverton City Hall where he read his essay at the city council meeting and received a certificate and a $50 gift card to Powell's Books.  It was apparently televised so I'll post the link once it's sent to me :)</div>
