<div class="post_text">I got to go to Lucy's track meet yesterday.  It's tough because they're typically at least an hour away and they start at 3:30 on a Wednesday.  Yesterday Andy was in charge of Carson so I could go.  Lucy ran the 1500, the 800 and the 4X400 Relay.  She got PR's in all of her events.  It was a beautiful and sunny day and I LOVE to see the way her team supports one another.  They're all watching all the races and very enthusiastically cheering for one another!  The very best part is depicted in the last picture.  After the whole meet is over the girls gather in a giant circle in the middle of the track and do a kind of jumping, dancing, singing cheer.  Yesterday it was funny to watch the boys team from Central Catholic watching all the girls :)  Gotta love high school!</div>
