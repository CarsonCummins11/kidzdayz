<div class="post_text">For the first time since, I think, Carson started school, Andy and I went away for the weekend.  We spent the weekend in Bend/Sunriver Oregon and had such a great time!  We did a lot of relaxing, some hiking, some running and a lot of eating :)  The kids were at home with our favorite friend/babysitter Elizabeth and also had a fabulous time!  Win win all the way around :) :)</div>
