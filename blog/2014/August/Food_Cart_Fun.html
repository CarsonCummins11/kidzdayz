<div class="post_text">Given that Portland is the Food Cart Capitol of the US we're trying to try out some more food carts this summer.  Today we went over to the East Side for lunch.  I had Greek Food and both the kids had some fantastic gourmet mac & cheese - we all LOVED what we got and will be doing some more exploring over the next few weeks!</div>
