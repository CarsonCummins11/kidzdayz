<div class="post_text">The kids have spent a big portion of the last few days converting the playhouse to Carson's new Invention Center/Lab.  It's very cool and I'm thrilled to have it out of the corner of his bedroom.  So far he's created a security system where a buzzer sounds when someone opens the door and he's working on a solar powered thermal heating system :)</div>
