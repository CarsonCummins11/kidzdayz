<div class="post_text">Carson spending the day in his "Lab" :)  He created a motor that he can make hover in the air for a few seconds as well as a "sink" that will run water when it's plugged in.  Today's quote of the day... "I got it to work, it hovered for like 30 seconds and I was freaking out and then the propeller flew off.  It's not supposed to do that..."</div>
