<div class="post_text">Our tour of New England started in Boston.  We had fabulous weather and a great time!  Our first day we walked the whole day!  We toured Copley Square, the Boston Public Gardens, Boston Commons and did the Freedom Trail tour followed by a walk across the river and a visit to the USS Constitution and dinner in Little Italy and cannolis at Mike's Pastry.  Another day we went for a run all along the esplanade on the river and then went to Salem for the day to learn about the witch trials :)</div>
