<div class="post_text">We had a busy start to spring break.  Lucy is volunteering at a 4th grade outdoor school next month so did a 2 day overnight training at the camp starting Friday after school.  Carson left Saturday afternoon to go to Grandma & Papa's to go ocean fishing on Sunday.  We went down last night and picked up Carson.  They hadn't seen one another since Thursday.  I was helping with dinner and looked over and they were sitting together on the couch just catching up :)  Had to snap a picture :)</div>
