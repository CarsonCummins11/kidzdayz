<div class="post_text">Over Memorial Day Weekend we met up with some friends we've known forever and don't see nearly often enough.  We went to Black Butte with the Carter's and had such a great time!!  We were neighbors when Lucy and Bailey were around 18 months old.  We both eventually moved so the kids are at different schools with all different activities so we don't get to see one another near enough.</div>
