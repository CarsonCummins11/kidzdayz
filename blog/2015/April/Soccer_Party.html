<div class="post_text">Carson's soccer season is theoretically done.  However, now we've entered tournament season so I guess not so much.  The families all got together to celebrate and had a fabulous party.  The boys had a blast playing basketball, hide and seek, cops and robbers, etc.  All the things boys are supposed to do :)</div>
