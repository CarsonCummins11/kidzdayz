<div class="post_text">Andy and Carson just returned home from a very fun trip back to Indiana.  Lucy and I were sad we didn't get to go see everyone!  Their first big outing was to Turkey Run State Park where they spent the day kayaking and then hiking with our nephew Jack.  By all accounts it was a fabulous day!!</div>
