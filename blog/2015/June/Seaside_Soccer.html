<div class="post_text">Carson had a sand soccer tournament all weekend.  Andy's in China so Carson went with the team on Friday night and Lucy and I drove over with Zoe.  We were very lucky with weather and the boys had a blast!  6 soccer games in 2 days and they got to stay in this fantastic lodge all together, the very best part!</div>
