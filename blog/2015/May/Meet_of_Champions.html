<div class="post_text">This weekend was Carson's Meet of Champions - the culmination of his track season this year.  He qualified in all of his races. He decided to run the 800 and the 1500 meters.  He ran the 800 on Saturday and the 1500 on Sunday.  His goal in the 800 was to beat 2:30, he got 2:28.  His goal in the 1500 was to beat 5:00.  He got 5:00.73 :)  That was an improvement on his previous personal best of 8 seconds though so I'm calling it a success.  Mostly he just loves running with his buddies :)</div>
