<div class="post_text">Carson's track coach got us tickets to the Prefontaine Classic down in Eugene.  It is one of the most prestigious track and field events in the US if not the world.  It was so amazing!  We saw Olympic champions as well as Olympic hopefuls, world champions, world record holders, etc.  There were runners there from all over the world.  All the best in the world!  We had great weather and got to watch a spectacular event!</div>
