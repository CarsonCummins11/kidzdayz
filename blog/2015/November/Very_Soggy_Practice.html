<div class="post_text">Carson had cross country practice tonight.  While there we had the most extreme rain we've had in a very long time, not to mention the wind!  When he got home he had to take his clothes off in the garage.  I had to wring them out in the sink.  His clothes were so wet it was as if he'd jumped in a lake... crazy!!  Great news was he had about 30 minutes at home and then got to head back out to soccer practice :-P  Crazy!!</div>
