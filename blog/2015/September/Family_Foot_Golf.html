<div class="post_text">Super fun family day today!  We went out to play foot golf.  It's exactly like golf except you kick a soccer ball instead of hitting a golf ball.  We played 18 holes in the extreme heat and I was whipped!  We kept score and Andy, Carson and Lucy were very close to one another.  I think Andy edged Lucy at the last hole and Carson was maybe one kick behind them.  I, on the other, won the award for highest score!  I was ridiculous!  I think they beat me by at least 10 points - probably closer to 20 :)  After nearly 3 hours of play, we tried a new restaurant where Lucy had the "best sandwich of her life" which was a grilled PB & J with pepper bacon and Havarti cheese!  Carson had a similar experience with his burger with pulled pork, bacon and ham!  Talk about a meat lovers meal!</div>
