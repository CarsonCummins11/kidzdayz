<div class="post_text">Lest Lucy be left out... She spent a big portion the day Saturday volunteering at a vision clinic for under privileged families.  She was so excited because she was the only person there who spoke Spanish and was able to translate for people all day!  She loved it!!  Most of the rest of the weekend was spent on homework!! :(</div>
