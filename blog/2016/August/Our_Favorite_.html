<div class="post_text">Liz and I went out for dinner tonight.  We came home and the kids instantly flocked to her.  We all sat and watched the Olympics for a while and I had to snap a picture because I think it's so sweet how they both still always want to be right by her when she's here!  We're so fortunate to have this lovely girl in our lives!!</div>
