<div class="post_text">When Lucy was in fourth grade she was on a team called The Griffins. They won the Regional Championships for the Battle of the Books.  Two of the girls who were on her team with her have remained her very good friends despite the fact that they're all at different schools.  Last night they had a sleepover and took a bunch of pictures.  I decided to do a before and after of the girls :)</div>
