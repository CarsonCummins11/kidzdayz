<div class="post_text">A stunning day on the mountain Sunday!!  We went up XC Skiing and took Lucy's friend Sabrina with us who was XC skiing for the first time.  We did a loop that's about 11 miles and includes about a mile or two of super hard skiing, down hill in very deep snow with a LOT of steep parts and quick turns.  I won't say Sabrina hated it as she was an exceptionally good sport!  I will say that, as the adults in the group, Andy and I should have vetoed that loop!  That said, it was a beautiful day and we all had a lot of fun :)</div>
