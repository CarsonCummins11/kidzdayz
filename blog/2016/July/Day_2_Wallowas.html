<div class="post_text">On our second day in the Wallowas we did a relatively epic hike!  I think I was tired after our adventures.  We hiked 9 miles and it felt like a LOT!  It was beautiful and we managed to mostly beat the rain so overall a great day but we were ready for some downtime after that!  The next day it rained all day so we decided to come home a day early.  All in all a very successful summer vacation!</div>
