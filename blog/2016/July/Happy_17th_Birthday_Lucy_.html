<div class="post_text">This year we're headed out of town the day after Lucy's birthday.  She decided she wanted to keep it simple with a family dinner.  Her cousin Ben's birthday is the day after Lucy's so they celebrated together.  Lucy had a special breakfast then she and Carson spent the day together.  They took Zoe for a long hike in Forest Park followed by lunch out, then a low key afternoon of board games and getting ready for dinner and our trip :)</div>
