<div class="post_text">We didn't manage to take many pictures but Lucy & I finished up our New England tour by flying to Chicago.  I planned a super long layover so we could all spend some time together and hang out with Andy's brother Neil and his family.  I only had the day there but Andy & Lucy spent the weekend.  We had great weather and a great time hanging out with everyone. </div>
