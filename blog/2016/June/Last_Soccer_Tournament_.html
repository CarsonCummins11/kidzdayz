<div class="post_text">Carson and Andy spent Memorial Day weekend in Medford/Ashland for Carson's last soccer tournament.  As he heads into high school he had to decide between cross country and soccer.  He has chosen cross country which means he is giving up soccer for the time being.  He and Andy spent a great weekend with his team as the last hurrah!  They had a great time!!</div>
