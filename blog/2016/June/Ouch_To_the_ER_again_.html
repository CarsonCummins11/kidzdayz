<h1 class="post_title">Ouch! To the ER again!</h1>

<div class="post_text">Last weekend during Carson's last soccer tournament he got kneed pretty hard in the ribs.  It hurt him bad enough that he didn't play anymore.  All week he complained about it but was basically fine.  He was running and, for the most part, living life normally.  Then Friday morning in class he had something in his hand and turned around to hand it to someone.  Apparently there was a loud pop and Carson hit the floor.  I got the call from school that his ribs were really hurting him now and that he needed to be picked up.  We called the pediatrician who said to take him to the ER right away as there was a fear of a punctured lung.  So off we went.  Good news/bad news... he has now officially broken a rib (they believe it was cracked last weekend and he turned just right to snap it the rest of the way).  That's the bad news.  The good news is that his lungs are just fine and he should be able to run again in a couple weeks.  Not to mention he got to miss a whole day of school over it :)</div>
