<div class="post_text">The boys did the Shamrock run again this year!  It was this morning - horrific timing, the day of daylight savings... so that 7:30 start time was SUPER early!  On top of that it was pouring rain all morning!  That said, I was the only one really complaining and given that I wasn't actually even running the race, I eventually calmed down :)  They both did the 15K (9.3 miles).  It has a very long, steep 3 mile up-hill section right in the middle but both boys did really great!  There were 4,571 people who finished the race.  Carson came in 114th overall and first in his age group.  He finished right at an hour averaging 6:36/mile.  Andy was not far behind but given how many people were in the race, finished around 430 - still top 10%.  Pretty darned impressive!  They both had a great time and I loved watching and cheering them on :)</div>
