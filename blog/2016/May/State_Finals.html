<div class="post_text">Carson is currently ranked the 12th fastest middle schooler in the state at the 3000 meters.  That qualified him to run in the State Finals.  They were held today in Corvallis.  He did great coming in 8th.  What a great way to cap off his middle school running career.  Now he truly can't wait to start running for his high school team!</div>
