<div class="post_text">Carson was one of the three freshman boys who were chosen to go on the travel meet this year.  They had to leave at 4am for the Tahoma co-ed relays.  They had an all freshman team with 3 boys and 2 girls.  They did really well coming in 12th out of 40 teams.  It was apparently a REALLY challenging course which included a run through a lake.  They had a great time.  After the race they had a BBQ at the park and then went (with all 30 highschoolers) to The Great Wolf Lodge for the night.  It sounds like it was quite a fabulous weekend!!</div>
