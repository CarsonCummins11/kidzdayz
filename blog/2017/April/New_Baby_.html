<div class="post_text">We could not be more excited to welcome this fabulous new family member!!!  Liz had her baby and he couldn't be more precious!  Lucy was SO sad that he was born when she was down in So. California.  She did make it back in time to meet him before they left the hospital.  We're all in love!</div>
