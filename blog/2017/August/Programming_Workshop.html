<div class="post_text">Carson has spent the last 3 weeks taking part in a programming workshop.  There were 40 high schoolers from all over the west coast who were chosen for their programming abilities.  They were split into teams of 4 and came up with a project/app.  They spent 9-3 every day working on the project and at the end presented it to the class and had an expo where they presented to people from Portland State University.  Carson loved it!</div>
