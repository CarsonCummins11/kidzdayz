<div class="post_text">Lucy and I were home alone when we heard an extremely loud thud.  Later Lucy was exceptionally startled and called me into the room.  This giant owl had crashed into our kitchen window.  After some time on lying on the deck it flew up to the railing.  It sat there for a long time before flying off.  Lucy was scared to death of it :)  Strange fears...</div>
