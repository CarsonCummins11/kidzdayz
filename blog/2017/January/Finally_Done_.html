<div class="post_text">OMG - between the snow, downtown protests and schedule changes Lucy's finals "week" lasted more than 2 weeks!  It is a HUGE deal to be done with her first semester of senior year!  Not only does she have an extremely rough course load but all the college apps, etc. made for an INSANE few months!  We went out for lunch to celebrate!  It is truly fabulous that she is now a second semester senior!!  That said it is truly terrible that she's a second semester senior :( :(  Time flies!!!</div>
