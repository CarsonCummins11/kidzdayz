<div class="post_text">I was so thrilled to find all kinds of spectacular photos of Carson's time at the high altitude running camp.  He so loves going and now I can more clearly see why!!  They run a LOT but also do a Steens Mtn Olympics, a cross-canyon team competition and a full day called Big Day which starts at 5am and includes them running/hiking 31 miles through some wild and beautiful terrain.  This year he came in 4th out of the 200 campers there on Big Day.  Carson definitely prefers the really long distances!</div>
