<div class="post_text">We made a last-minute decision to drive to Bend (3.5 hours away) to watch Carson race on Friday.  We're so glad we went. We thought Carson's ankle was all better.  He was able to practice on Wednesday and Thursday.  Well, midway through the race on Friday he was headed downhill and got jostled by another runner and stepped wrong again.  He kept going but was limping heavily.  His coach pulled him out of the race.  That said, Carson kept going hopping more than a mile on one foot while various people were trying to convince him to drop.  Andy and I finally caught up with him with one of his coaches when he had about 200 meters to go. We got him off the course but he wasn't happy about it :(  He iced it and laid low for the rest of the meet but he still couldn't put any weight on it.  Andy & I decided to take him to urgent care.  It was all fun and games (relatively) until they came in and said he had a fracture in his foot and he would be out of running for 4-6 weeks... in other words, the rest of the season :( :( :(  We're going to an orthopedist tomorrow for a second opinion and are REALLY hoping it's not as bad as we've been told.  We'll see.  One way or another, very bad timing. </div>
