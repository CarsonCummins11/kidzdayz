<div class="post_text">I didn't really realize just how much I missed Lucy until she finally came home!  I wasn't the only one either :)  She had a ridiculously intense week of finals and then a 5:45am flight the morning after her last final.  She got home mid-day and managed to make it through dinner then went to bed at 8pm and slept until 1:30pm the next day!  She definitely needs a break!!!</div>
