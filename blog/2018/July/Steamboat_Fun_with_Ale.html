<div class="post_text">On our first day in Steamboat my nephew Ale, who is living in Denver over the summer doing an internship, drove to Steamboat with a friend who was visiting to hang out with us.  We had a truly fantastic day!  We rode the mountain coaster which was so fast and scary, shopped, ate and generally played all day - so fun!</div>
