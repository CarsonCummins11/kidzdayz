<div class="post_text">Despite a bit of rain and cold weather, camp was a big hit again this year! They do a LOT of running including a camp race and an uphill race. They have a date night where girls ask boys to dinner , a karaoke night and many other entertaining things - likely to keep their minds off all that running! Overall pretty good team bonding and some good altitude training :)</div>
