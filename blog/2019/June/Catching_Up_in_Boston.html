<div class="post_text">Lucy has been meeting up with people from my/her past while in Boston this summer.  First was Cate Danielson.  Cate's parents, Cekiel and Jill were close friends of ours before any of us had kids.  Lucy and Cate were born a month apart but just before she was born her parents moved to Brazil.  We stayed connected and Lucy and Cate met once when they were 2 months old and once when they were 15.  Cate's family wound up moving to Singapore for most of Cate's life and she and Lucy were pen pals for several years while she was living there.  Now Cate is going to Northeastern University and she and Lucy have reconnected.  They had dinner and are planning to hang out more before Cate leaves for the summer :)</div>

<div class="post_text">Another meet-up was with my friend and roommate from College, Wendy.  They met for lunch and Lucy talked with Wendy's son Colby about University of Richmond because he's seriously considering going there :) By all accounts everyone had a great time!  Such a small world!</div>
