<div class="post_text">Lucy finished finals (done with sophomore year :( ) and headed out on a trip with her buddies.Â  They went to one of the girls' house in West Hartford, CT, another girl's lake house in CT and one of the boys houses in RI. By all accounts they had a blast and it was a great way to kick off the summer!</div>
