<div class="post_text">One of my very favorite things to do is to go to the Portland Rose Gardens and then run on the trails in Washington Park above them. I come back and walk through the rose gardens as my cool down and it brings me great joy! Today the roses were just at the end of their blooming season and the smell was spectacular!!</div>
