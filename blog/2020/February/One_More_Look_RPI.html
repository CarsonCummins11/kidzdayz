<div class="post_text">Carson was recruited to run at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, one of his top choice schools.  This past weekend they had the recruits come to campus to meet the team and coach as well as just spend some time on campus and get a bit more familiar.  It was super fun for Carson! He stayed two nights with one of the XC guys, attended some classes, tried out the food and attended a hockey game.  This is definitely one of the top choices at this point.  I spent the 1.5 days hanging out, getting to know the city and the campus a little bit.  It's much nicer than I had thought :)  On Saturday we drove back to New Jersey to fly out of Newark. On the way we stopped to have dinner with good friends Rip and Glynis and their son Finn.  The boys are both seniors going through the same process at the moment.  So fun catching up with them!</div>
