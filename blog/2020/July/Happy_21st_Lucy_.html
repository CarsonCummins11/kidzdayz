<div class="post_text">Another birthday away from home :(  I guess I need to realize that's the new normal... Lucy had a great 21st! Lots of fun gifts from friends and family, she had her favorite bowl for lunch, spent the afternoon at the river and and then they went to Ethiopian food for dinner. No wild parties, but sounds like it was a lovely day! </div>
