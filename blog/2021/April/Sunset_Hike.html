<h1 class="post_title">Sunset Hike</h1>

<div class="post_text">I took a longer, less-traveled hike to get to the top of the very popular Cathedral Rock. Parking at the main trailhead was next to impossible so I thought I was pretty clever to figure out my alternate route. Well, it was all fun and games until I stayed a bit too long at the top of the rock to catch the full sunset. It was so beautiful and well worth the crazy climb to get to the top. Â However...... I started hiking back (4.5 miles) just after the sun had fully set. Not really sure why I didn't realize at the time that would be a bad idea. I wound up somewhat lost in the dark for more than an hour. I was scared to death but was VERY lucky that I'd put a headlamp in my backpack and had a trail app on my phone that eventually lead me back to my car. I was never so happy to be back to civilization in my life!!!</div>
