<div class="post_text">Carson and Elena, along with a high school friend of Carsons, are off on a hiking adventure around Mt. Rainier. They were lucky to win a permit in the lottery in January and are finally heading out for the trip. They're hiking 100+ miles over 8 days. Me watching them prepare (at the last minute) and get ready to head out was pretty high anxiety, but they're off and hopefully having a blast!</div>
