<div class="post_text">Andy and I got to join in for the awards ceremony for the Virginia Governors awards where Lucy was honored. They had the ceremony via Zoom where the governor spoke and then there was a video for each recipient. Lucy was honored for her work with a clinic called Health Brigade where she was working as a medical interpreter when Covid hit. Once the pandemic happened she was asked to add to her role and also set up and manage a Covid testing and eventually a vaccination effort, along with her interpreting duties. It was so fantastic to hear all the great things she did and to be able to see her recognized for her contribution :)</div>
