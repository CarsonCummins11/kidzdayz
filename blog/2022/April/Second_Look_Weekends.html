<div class="post_text">After a shocking amount of work, twenty plus application and ten interviews, Lucy narrowed her final med school decision down to Duke and Brown. Accepted students were invited to visit to help to make a final decision. We went together to Durham for the Duke weekend. Elena who is at U Richmond (following Lucy's footsteps), just two hours away, drove down to join us for a day. It was so fun to see her.  Lucy then flew up to Providence, RI to visit Brown with some friends from Boston.  Final decision turned out to be fairly easy after the two weekends.... Duke it is!!</div>
