<div class="post_text">We were SO lucky that Andy's sisters Patsy and Mary came to Durham to help us with the move-in. Actually, Patsy flew to Boston to help Andy with the drive down with Lucy's stuff. We had a great time and things went so much faster thanks to our fantastic helpers :) We took a little time out and did a tour of Lucy's new campus. Everyone bought a shirt to support Lucy's new endeavor :)</div>
