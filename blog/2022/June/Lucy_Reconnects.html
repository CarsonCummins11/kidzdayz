<div class="post_text">When Lucy came home unexpectedly for 5 months, she hadn't lived at home for more than a few weeks since she graduated high school. She pretty quickly reached out to and rekindled relationships with friends from elementary school and high school. I think it was a real bonus for her to get back in touch with old friends. So nice to have her home for a short time again :)</div>
