<div class="post_text">Carson has followed distance running since he was in middle school. His ultimate dream is to run the Western States 100. He and Andy rented a car and drove from SF to Lake Tahoe. They camped out and got up at 4am for the 5am start. After the start, they did a hike and then drove to one of the aid stations before driving on to the finish line before driving all the way back to San Francisco. I can't imagine running 100 miles through the mountains, heat and wilderness of Northern CA but if/when Carson decides to do it, we'll definitely be there on the support crew :)</div>
