<div class="post_text">Andy is pretty swamped at work right now so won't be taking much time off around Christmas.  So, today the kids and I decided to head up to the snow on our own.  We spent the day cross country skiing and had a blast!!  It was such a welcome relief from all the rain. </div>

<div class="post_text">We skiied the first half of the loop then stopped by Trillium lake and built a snowman and a big snow fort.  This is always Carson's favorite part.  Usually Daddy's in charge but it was actually a lot of fun for me.  I had to cut it short after about 1.5 hours because we had about 2 hours to ski the rest of the loop and I was VERY worried about being lost in the dark with the kids!  We made out in plenty of time, but man did I make the kids ski fast on the way out :)  I had such images of building snow caves and sleeping outside all the while regretting not having watched more "Man VS. Wild"</div>
