<div class="post_text">Carson did not want to do a party for his 9th b-day.  He wanted to just have his buddy Jack over for a sleep-over.  I was all for the simplicity but felt a little guilty.  We decided at the last minute to surprise the 3 kids with a trip to the Great Wolf Lodge, an indoor water park about an hour north of Portland.  They couldn't have been more thrilled!  The surprise was very fun for all of us :)</div>
