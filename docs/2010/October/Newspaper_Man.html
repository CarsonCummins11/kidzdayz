<div class="post_text">Carson has started his own daily newspaper called The Sub.  It includes a main news story, a Food Day section, comics, a jobs section and advertising.  He has 3 subscribers (the only other people living in the house).  He has a collection envelope which he leaves on your pillow to remind you that it's time to pay up.  He's very proud and very serious about the paper.</div>
