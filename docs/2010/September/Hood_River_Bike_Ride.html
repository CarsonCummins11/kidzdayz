<div class="post_text">We went to Hood River and did a bike ride we'd been wanting to do.  It's along an old rail line that is now paved and blocked off so it's only for bikes and pedestrians.  It follows the Columbia River up the gorge so it was truly beautiful.  We went with our friends the Porter's.  Everyone had a great time.  A nice way to end the summer...</div>
