<div class="post_text">Today was the final presentation for Carson's class he's been doing.  The 5 kids presented their topics and explained what their projects were then we all toured the exhibits.  Carson did a museum walk of Theodore Roosevelt.  It was really great!  He LOVED this class!  Not sure if it was Miss Larsen or the class.  Probably a combination :)</div>
