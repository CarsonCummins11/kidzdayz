<div class="post_text">For the past 9 months or so Lucy and two of her friends have been volunteering at a homeless family shelter.  They are "Kid Time Hosts" which means they go and babysit the kids while the adults take care of whatever business they need to at the shelter up to bed time.  Lucy has loved it and always really enjoys all the kids.  Well, of course the shelter doesn't have a lot of resources and the girls felt like they were really lacking in toys, etc. for the kids so they decided to do a Toy and Toiletry drive.  Toys for the kids and toiletries for the adults.</div>

<div class="post_text">They made posters and flyers as well as large wrapped bins for toys.  They started with school.  They went early one morning and passed out flyers to all the kids as they walked into school.  Lucy also asked at our local frozen yogurt shop if they could put posters, flyers and a bin in there, and they very graciously agreed.</div>

<div class="post_text">Well, after a few weeks of collecting and a lot of work, today they got to deliver their gifts to the shelter.  I picked them up early from school and we took everything down.  It was fantastic!  They got more donations than the shelter has ever gotten.  We filled two large SUV's with all the loot.  The people at the shelter said this will be the first year where they won't have to buy anything at all and they'll likely have enough to put aside for birthdays throughout the year :)</div>

<div class="post_text">What a great experience for all of us!  Thanks very much to my friends and family who donated!!</div>
