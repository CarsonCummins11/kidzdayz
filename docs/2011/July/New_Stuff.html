<div class="post_text">My appliances all started dying at once, so... we had to do a giant unplanned replacement of appliances.  I tried to talk Andy into new countertops as long as we were at it but he wasn't buying.  I'm not a huge cooking fan, but I am pretty happy with the new stuff.  If only it had been free :)</div>
