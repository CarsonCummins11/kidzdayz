<div class="post_text">On our third day in DC tragedy struck at the Air & Space Museum.  We spent the morning on a tour of the White House and then finishing up at the American History Museum.  Then headed across the mall to the Air & Space Museum.  We started out with lunch  in their cafeteria, then about 2 hours into our touring around what is a truly impressive and spectacular place, Carson realized he'd left his jacket in the cafeteria.  By the time we went back it was gone.  Now this is the jacket he'd gotten 4 days before for his birthday which he'd worn non-stop.  He was SO sad!!  We did a ton of back-tracking and looking around and went to lost and found 4 times but to no avail.  We did finish up the museum but Carson had a VERY hard time recovering.  Especially on the long walk back to the hotel when the sun was down and it was pretty chilly!  Poor guy!  He did finally recover but it took nearly 2 days.</div>

<div class="post_text">We spent our last day going to all the museums we hadn't had time for.  We spent the morning at the National Geographic Museum then headed down to the Bureau of Engraving where we saw money being printed. Everyone was sufficiently impressed.  Then we headed over to the Natural History Museum where we spent the rest of the afternoon.  Lucy and I had gone to the one in New York and liked it but it wasn't our favorite so we weren't anticipating this needing much time.  However, it was truly spectacular so we were sad when it was closing down and we were still not through everything we wanted to see!</div>
