<div class="post_text">Carson is fishing today with Grandma and Papa.  They went VERY early this morning and when I got up I had these pictures in my inbox.  This is apparently a 25lb. salmon.  I'm very glad I'm not there because it's a bit sad to me.  However, when I get my fillets I'll be a lot less sad!  I talked to Carson and he apparently caught it "almost" all by himself and said it was "awesome"!!</div>
