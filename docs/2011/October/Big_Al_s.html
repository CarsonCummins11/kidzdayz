<div class="post_text">Carson's birthday is next Friday.  However, we're leaving for DC on Saturday so we decided to do the friend celebration this weekend.  Night 1 was a trip to "Big Al's" bowling alley/arcade with two buddies plus a sleepover.  Lots and lots of giggling.  The whole drive home was all about making up names where you could say the word fart then they'd all laugh hysterically.  Gotta love boys :)</div>
