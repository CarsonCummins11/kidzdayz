<div class="post_text">First day of school 2011-12.  Although it was very sad to see our summer break come to an end, the kids were finally excited to head back to school today.  Lucy had an outfit picked out last week (with input from friends via phone pictures sent back and forth).  I asked Carson yesterday what he wanted to wear for the first day.  His response... "um, I don't care - maybe I'll just wear what I wore today". </div>

<div class="post_text">The day was a success for both.  However, not much has changed.  Carson came home today without his jacket and lunchbox...</div>
