<div class="post_text">With the weather being so nice of late we decided to BBQ our dinner.  Of course, it started pouring rain just as Andy went out to do it.  He's a real Oregonian now so he just put on his gear and did it anyway :)  In true Oregon Spring fashion it ws beautiful 10 minutes after he was done.</div>
