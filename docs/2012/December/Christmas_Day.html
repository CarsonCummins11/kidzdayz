<div class="post_text">We spent most of Christmas day hanging out at home.  It was lovely!  Kids got up at exactly 8am - the time we'd agreed on.  I thought Lucy might sleep in this year as she has started to do but no dice.  It's probably good since Carson would have lost his mind!  We opened presents, had a great breakfast and then hung out most of the day.  Grandma and Papa came over in the afternoon to check out the loot and then we all went to Aunt Jamie's for a casual dinner.  Great day all the way around!</div>
