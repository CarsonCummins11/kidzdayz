<div class="post_text">The kids had a day off school today.  Both kids had friends over all day.  Lucy and her friend Ajitha spent 6+ hours working on their board for the science fair.  Carson and Jack, on the other hand, rode unicycles, played baseball and lazer tag and then folded about 50 origami cranes :)  I think the boys had more fun :)</div>
