<div class="post_text">We spent the morning at the gym and on the way home the kids told us they were planning to make us a "fancy" lunch.  While Andy and I took our showers they prepared all kinds of appetizer-type foods for us including a peanut butter and jelly sandwich cut into 4 pieces :)  It was a great lunch and very sweet :)</div>
