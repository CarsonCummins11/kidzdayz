<div class="post_text">Today Carson did a play in his class - his group was a group of boys doing a play that had male and female roles.  Carson played the female lead and had a blast.  His little buddy class of first graders came to watch and laughed hysterically every time he did his high-pitched female voice - very cute :)</div>
