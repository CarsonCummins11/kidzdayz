<div class="post_text">Well, it's confirmed.  The Queen is stalking us!  We went this morning to see the changing of the guards at Buckingham Palace and there was a massive crowd when we got there.  Well, we quickly figured out that the queen was expected at any moment.  We got to see her drive by with her husband - I'm pretty sure she waved right at me :)  There were helicopters hovering all over and a fly-by by five fighter jets from the Royal Airforce followed by a very old war plane which dropped red glitter all over the place.  It's quite a spectacle when the queen shows up!!</div>

<div class="post_text">After changing of the guards - which Carson loved!, we split up.  Lucy and I went to Covent Garden and Leicester Square and shopped around while Andy and Carson went to Wembley Stadium to tour the soccer facilities.  We met up late in the afternoon at the British Museum, had some dinner and then went to see the musical "We Will Rock You" which was FANTASTIC!!</div>
