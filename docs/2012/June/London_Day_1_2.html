<div class="post_text">Our European adventure has begun!  We made it to London with no real problems - other than the lack of sleep...  We arrived on Sunday at around noon and really just needed to stay awake the first day.  We got situated in our apartment and then took the tube to Trafalgar Square just to do some looking around followed by a trip to Harrods and dinner.  We all slept very well that first night :)</div>

<div class="post_text">Day two was much more busy.  We went back to Trafalgar Square and then walked over to see Westminster Abbey and the House of Parliament.  After a few tours there we took a river cruise up and down the Thames followed by a lovely ride around the London Eye.  A very busy day indeed.</div>
