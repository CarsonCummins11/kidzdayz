<div class="post_text">Wednesday we spent the day in Windsor, the Queen's official residence.  We think she may be stalking us because when we went to Buckingham Palace she was there (we know because of the flag flying), and then we went to Windsor the very next day and she was there... we even saw one of her dogs.  You'd think she'd have better things to do...</div>

<div class="post_text">Anyway, we had a great time in Windsor touring the castle and the town.  It was our most low key day.  We got back in time for me to go for a run and Andy played a bit of soccer with the kids then we had dinner in our apartment and I did some laundry.  It was a nice evening :)</div>
