<div class="post_text">One of our very favorite people had a birthday this past weekend.  Elizabeth has been babysitting our kids since Carson was a baby.  She's become a second mom, big sister, and friend to them.  This is the birthday card Carson created for her.  I thought the sentiment was super sweet and funny so I decided to share it.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY LIZ!!!!  WE LOVE YOU!!!</div>
