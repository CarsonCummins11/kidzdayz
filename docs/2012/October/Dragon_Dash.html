<div class="post_text">I love that our school only has one real fundraiser per year!  They do a jog-a-thon and if they raise enough money they don't do anymore!  Carson loves the "Dragon Dash".  This year he's in pretty good shape from playing soccer.  They had 25 minutes to run around their track.  He ran 3.5 miles.  I ran all but the first half mile with him (I can't believe he still wants me to run with him! I asked if he wanted me to.  He said "of course", I said "but I'll be the only mom running", he said "mom, I'm already a geek - I don't care at all what other people think of me".  Not sure what to make of that attitude but I'm not turning him down!)  It is a good thing this is his last year at Findley.  I'm thinking that by next year I couldn't keep up with him - we were pushing my outer limits a bit...</div>
