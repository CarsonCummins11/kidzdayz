<div class="post_text">When I got married I'm pretty sure I signed a contract stating that there were certain things that would always be "the husbands job" ... things like taking out the trash, rodent removal, changing outside light bulbs ... you know things like that.  Well I know that carving pumpkins was on that list!  Well, Andy's in Asia and I really tried to talk the kids into just decorating pumpkins or maybe painting them or something.  No such luck!  However, I was lucky in that we were invited to Aunt Jamie's and they offered to carve pumpkins there.  I decided it's like exercise... sometimes you REALLY don't feel like doing it but you're always glad you did when it's over.  :)</div>
