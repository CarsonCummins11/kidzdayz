<div class="post_text">Had a super fun day on Sunday!  Andy's birthday is on Tuesday along with a lot of after school activities and work... so we decided to have our fun day on Sunday.  We went out to Hood River to do the Fruit Loop.  On the way we went hiking at Starvation Creek and had a little picnic.  We went to several stops along the Fruit Loop which is an area in the Columbia River Gorge where there is an abundance of orchards.  We picked apples and pears and bought jam, ice cream and fabulous homemade cookies.  Very fun all the way around.  Then we stopped in Hood River to check out the kite boarders on the Columbia.  It's always ranked among the very top places in the world to do kite boarding and wind-surfing.  It was SO cool to watch!  When we got back to Portland went to a large parking lot surrounded by food carts to have dinner.  This is quite trendy.  We all bought food from a different cart and met in the middle at the picnic tables.  Super fun day all the way around :)</div>
