<div class="post_text">Today was Carson's first day of 5th grade!  Lucy doesn't officially start until tomorrow but went today because she's an 8th grade "Jagual Leader" so she helped out the 6th graders on their first day.  She had fun and got to come home at noon and hang out with a friend so it was all good :)  I can't believe Carson's in his last year of elementary and next year Lucy's off to high school!  How did that happen????</div>
