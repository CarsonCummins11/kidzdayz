<div class="post_text">Lucy's school (and Carson's next year) had a community run this morning.  It was a great event.  We all 4 signed up because Lucy wanted to sign up so we figured one of us would run with Lucy and one with Carson.  Well... Carson ended up beating us all.  He came in 11th overall (out of more than 300).  He won first in his age group with a 5K time of 21:43 which is right at exactly a 7 minute mile.  Andy was very close behind him but didn't beat him ;). Lucy ended up running with friends so I ran on my own, or actually with a lot of very loud-breathing older men :)  </div>

<div class="post_text">Then when we were done the kids were asked to "lead-off" the younger kids who did a 1K - they thought that was very cool.  It was a great morning at our house!</div>
