<div class="post_text">At 6:30 Friday morning Andy and I decided we were all going to play hooky and head up to the mountain for a day of downhill skiing.  It was funny to see the kids being a bit reluctant at first - not so sure about "getting caught" missing school.  I was actually honest with Carson's teacher and simply told Lucy's school that she wouldn't be in.  Andy called in to a meeting while we were eating lunch and I had to cancel several appointments.  It was SO worth it!  We all had a fantastic day!  It was beautiful, as you can see, the snow was perfect and there was no one there!!  After lunch we let the kids go off on their own.  This is a huge milestone that Andy and I used to wistfully discuss :)  </div>
