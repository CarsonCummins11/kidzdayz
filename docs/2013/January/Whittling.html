<div class="post_text">Carson has a plantar wart on the bottom of his heel.  It has gotten progressively more painful over the past few months so we finally went to the Dr. to have it removed.  This picture was when he was still laughing and having a good time!  </div>

<div class="post_text">When the Dr. started working on him he had to use a little knife to remove some of the surface skin, etc.  He asked Carson if he knew what whittling was.  Carson said "as a matter of fact, I'm quite good at whittling away at my mom's patience"  :)  Very funny.  He really LOVED how cool the liquid nitrogen was.  However, the pain of having it burned/frozen off was a bit much after a while!  I don't recommend it!</div>
