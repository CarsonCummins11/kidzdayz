<div class="post_text">One of our goals for the summer was to have the kids learn a bit about cooking and to help out with making dinners.  One night a week each kid is in charge of making dinner.  Wednesday night was Lucy's turn.  She made chicken stuffed with pesto and mozzarella and ceasar salad with home made dressing.  Super Yummy!!!</div>
