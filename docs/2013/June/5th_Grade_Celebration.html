<div class="post_text">Wednesday was the 5th Grace Celebration - a graduation of sorts from elementary school.  They had pizza and ice cream sundaes with some fun and games in the field followed by an assembly with a slide show and lots of skits and presentations.  It was lots of fun but Carson was basically ready to just be done!</div>
