<h1 class="post_title">Last Day of School - Lucy</h1>

<div class="post_text">Lucy's last day included an early morning so she could get ready at home then go to the home of one of the girls in her class where all the girls met up for breakfast and last minute primping before walking to school.  At school they had a graduation ceremony of sorts in their hall followed by a massive carnival-like celebration at the school which Lucy says was awesome!  Then she and 14 of her "closest" friends walked to the local fro-yo/Starbucks area where they were doing a big festival of sorts to commemorate the last day of school.  Following that they walked to one of the girls' houses and had a "dance party" before heading to Olive Garden for dinner and I'm sure a lot of giggling and talking.  She was thrilled and had a fantastic end to a somewhat turbulent middle school experience :)</div>
