<div class="post_text">What a fantastic Easter we had!  We started the day with the hunt for the Easter baskets and a joint Easter gift of a giant pool toy.  Then we took Zoe for a walk and had a family soccer game in a nearby field followed by a quick visit/tea with our good friends the Coopers.  Then it was off to Grandma's for the real festivities!  We had a great dinner followed by the egg hunt which involves about 250 eggs for 5 kids.  Then, following our latest tradition we had a baseball game followed by a family soccer game.  It couldn't have been a nicer day - 75 degrees and perfect in Oregon today!!</div>
