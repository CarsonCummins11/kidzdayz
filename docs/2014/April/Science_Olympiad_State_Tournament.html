<div class="post_text">Crazy day for Carson today!  First he ran in his first track meet of the spring season.  He ran the 3000 meter even though that's not really his race.  It's the first race of the meet and we were in a rush ;)  After that we ran off to the State Science Olympiad Tournament where we spent the entire day.  He competed in 3 events, Robocross (where they designed and built a robot which had to preform various tasks), Rotor Egg Drop (where they built a helicopter device which had to transport an egg slowly and without breaking the egg from a high drop) and Solar Systems (a ridiculously hard test about WAY too much).  It was a long day for both of us but his team came in 4th overall so that was good.  Quite an experience for him.  </div>
