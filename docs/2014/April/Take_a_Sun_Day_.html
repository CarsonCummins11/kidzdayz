<div class="post_text">It's 75 and sunny in Portland today.  I decided to surprise Carson this afternoon.  I went to school after lunch and picked him up.  We rode bikes to get frozen yogurt and then headed out on a 2 hour bike ride.  Fantastic way to spend an afternoon!!  The look on his face when I surprised him at school was priceless :) :)</div>
