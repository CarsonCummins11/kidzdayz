<div class="post_text">The annual Foster Lake camping trip was a huge success this year despite a day or two of rain. Â We had a lot of good food, played a lot of fun games (including everyone's new favorite Kan Jam), celebrated Elena's birthday with a fantastic "Amazing Race" game, did a lot of kayaking and spent a lot of time hanging out in the boat tubing, water skiing, wake boarding and knee boarding.</div>
