<div class="post_text">Our last 2 days were spent in the fabulous city of Ashland where we went to the Oregon Shakespeare Festival.  We saw "The Tempest" and "A Comedy of Errors" and spent a lot of time playing.  We happened to figure out at the last minute that our neighbors were going to be in Ashland at the same time as us so we hooked up with them for dinner and one of the plays.  It was nice for the kids to hang out with Beatrice :)  A great week!</div>
