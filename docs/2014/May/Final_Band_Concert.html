<div class="post_text">Carson has been playing the trombone in the school band (exclusively at school.  I think he practiced at home once...).  The last band concert was Tuesday night.  There are over 100 kids in the 6th grade band. It was amazing to hear their progress from the first concert to the last :)  Also amazing was the fact that Andy managed to be out of town for every single band concert this year.  Hmm....</div>
