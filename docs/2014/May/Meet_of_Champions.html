<div class="post_text">Carson's track season closed with the Meet of Champions last weekend.  It's run over two days.  He ran the 1500 meter and the 800 meter races, one on each day.  Saturday was a beautiful day.  He ran the 800 and came in 7th out of the 60+ kids who qualified for this final championship meet.  He did it in 2:36 which was a personal record for him.  He was pretty happy.  Sunday was a crazy weather day with torrential downpours, lightning and lots of sun breaks.  He ran the 1500 in the rain but had a great race.  He led the race for the first 2.5 laps and ended up getting second in his heat.  He ended up with a time of 5:17 which is another big personal record for him.  It is a super fun event with some extraordinary runners.  There were 8th graders running 4:20 1500 meter races... crazy!!</div>
