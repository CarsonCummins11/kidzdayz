<div class="post_text">Such a fun weekend all the way around at our house!  Lucy and I headed to the beach on Friday night as Andy and Carson headed for the meet in Eugene.  We went to Cannon Beach to the St. Mary's Academy Mother/Daughter beach weekend.  We were extraordinarily lucky with the weather and had a truly memorable and amazing time!</div>
