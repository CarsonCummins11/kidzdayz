<div class="post_text">Dad's out of town for the weekend visiting his parents in Indiana.  We decided to head downtown to Saturday Market.  I forgot that the Rose Festival is on at the moment (picture a county fair), we decided to take a walk along the waterfront and first Carson was asked if he had any marijuana followed within a minute or two by us watching a guy drop a box filled with syringes... Carson was somewhat scandalized :)</div>
