<div class="post_text">Carson had a whole day off from soccer and cross country on Sunday so he and dad did a big bike ride - ending up at a soccer field for a little extra practice...  Apparently it was super fun.  Lucy and I were at a play at St. Mary's for the afternoon - lovely weekend all around.</div>
