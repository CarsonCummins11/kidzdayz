<div class="post_text">Halloween was a busy night at our house.  Carson went to a sleep-over with a group of friends after winning second place in the 7th grade costume contest (he wrote Gingerbread Man on a t-shirt and then taped bread on it and went as the Gingerbread Man :) ).  Lucy had friends over for games and watching her first horror movie :)</div>
