<div class="post_text">Lucy's going to miss her District Championships for cross country when we're in Chicago in a few weeks so Friday was her last meet.  She definitely went out with a bang!  It was a beautiful day, a great course and she got a huge PR finally breaking 24 minutes for the 5K.  Way to go Lucy!!</div>
