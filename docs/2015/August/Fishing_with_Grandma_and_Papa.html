<div class="post_text">On our way home from Yosemite we stopped and dropped Carson off with Grandma and Papa to go on a fishing trip.  Lucy was supposed to go too but she wasn't feeling super hot and had a ton of summer homework to finish up so she, very sadly, missed out.  I think Carson is very much enjoying being the center of attention :)</div>
