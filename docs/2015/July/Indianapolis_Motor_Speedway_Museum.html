<div class="post_text">After soccer camp they had a little time to kill in Indianapolis so they went to the Indi 500 Museum.  Apparently it's worth doing and a good way to kill a few hours when waiting for a flight.  They got home the night after Lucy left for Nicaragua so neither of them will see her for 4 weeks :(</div>
