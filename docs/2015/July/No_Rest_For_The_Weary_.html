<div class="post_text">Got home late from camp and dinner, a long shower and then off to bed.  Then off to bed for an early morning.  His soccer team had a tournament all weekend and he got to show up for the final game.  He played the whole game and got to be there for celebration!  He then had some friends over for the afternoon to swim and hang out.  By dinner time he was literally falling asleep in his plate! :)  Recovered now and ready for the next adventure!</div>
