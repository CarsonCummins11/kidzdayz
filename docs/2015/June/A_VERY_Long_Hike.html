<h1 class="post_title">A VERY Long Hike</h1>

<div class="post_text">At the last minute we decided to go for a hike on Sunday.  We were planning a short 5-6 mile loop in a new area for us in Washington state.  Well, logging roads apparently close over time and we weren't able to find the trailhead we were looking for.  We ended up doing an out and back on another trail.  We found some fantastic views and had a great time but it was a LOT more than we'd planned.  We had very little water and not a ton of food but decided to hike just under 12 miles in some pretty serious heat.  Everyone was a good sport until the end when we were all (except maybe Carson) really ready to be done!  Carson isn't in many of the pictures because he decided to use this as a training opportunity and did a lot of running way ahead of us while carrying the backpack with all the food and water.  Zoe was a stress case needing to "herd" us back together - running up to Carson and back to us.  By the time it was all done Zoe couldn't even jump up into or out of the car - she was exhausted and we were all very thirsty!!!  Fun day with a little more adventure than planned :)</div>
