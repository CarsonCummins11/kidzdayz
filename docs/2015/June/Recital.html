<div class="post_text">I fear this is Carson's last year of dance :(  He had his recital on Saturday night and he wasn't overly enthusiastic about it.  However, you'd never know by the fantastic performance!  He was in a boys jazz class and it was a blast to watch him.  I'm secretly hoping that he'll decide to do it again but I won't be holding my breath...</div>
