<div class="post_text">Just before I left for Ale's graduation we learned that Lucy had been selected for a few awards.  Every year St. Mary's has an academics award night.  Lucy was selected (out of the 200 sophomores in her school) as the best Science student.  She was also selected as the best Spanish III student.  This is a pretty big deal and I was very sad to miss the awards ceremony!  Dad and Carson were there and took pictures for me, which I've only just now found :)</div>
