<div class="post_text">Thursday was our day to explore the whole island!  We started with the more rain forested areas then drove all along the beautiful beaches to the North Shore where the very famous surfing beaches are.  Along the way we stopped in various little towns and tried the famous local garlic shrimp and got Hawaiian Shave Ice.  It was a fantastic day and Oahu is a truly beautiful island!</div>
