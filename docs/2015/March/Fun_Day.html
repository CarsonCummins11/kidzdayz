<div class="post_text">Fun day at our house. Â Andy and Carson spent the entire day playing paintball with Carson's buddy Levi, Lucy went to the school play with the 5th grader she works with as a science mentor and I spent the afternoon picking wallpaper off the bathroom wall one inch at a time :)</div>
