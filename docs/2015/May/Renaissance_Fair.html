<div class="post_text">Carson had his Renaissance Fair this week at school.  He did a research project on a man who invented the scientific method and presented it on a board at the fair.  He also created a computer game set in a town in the middle ages and was very popular all evening with kids wanting to play it :)  Costumes were required.  I love that he's still willing to put it out there and dress up like this!</div>
