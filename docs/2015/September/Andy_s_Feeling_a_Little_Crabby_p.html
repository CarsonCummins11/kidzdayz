<div class="post_text">This is actually a few weeks old but Lucy found it and we thought it was funny :)  My parents brought us some crab they'd just caught. Andy's the one true crab lover in the family so he went to town all on his own.  Notice the tools he used... not a very delicate operation :)</div>
