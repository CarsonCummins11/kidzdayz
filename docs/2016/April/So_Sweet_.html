<div class="post_text">Carson's time coaching indoor soccer at the Boys & Girls Club came to an end.  He's moved on to coaching basketball with a lot of the same kids.  He loves it!  Last night the kids presented him with a soccer ball they'd all signed as a thank you for coaching.  He was so pleased!!  It's been a great experience!</div>
