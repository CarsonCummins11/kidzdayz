<div class="post_text">Carson came to me a while back saying he wanted to tutor kids in math.  We looked around for opportunities and decided on the Boys and Girls Club.  Well, for the moment, his soccer practices directly conflict with their math/computer science volunteer time slots so they asked if he'd be willing to help coach indoor soccer.  He has loved doing it!  They have practice on Wednesdays and games on Fridays.  He works with kids in grades 1-3 first and then kids in grades 4-6.  I snuck in this week to watch the games.  It was so fun seeing him working with these kids :) :)</div>
