<div class="post_text">SO funny!  Andy went to the grocery store this weekend and they were giving out game pieces to possibly win prizes.  Lucy and I were working on something in the kitchen and we could hear Andy & Carson in the dining room... "Yes! I've got another Daisy Sour Cream!" ... and ... "I just need one more Ranch Dressing!"  They didn't win anything but spent a LOT of time on it and apparently really had fun doing it :) :)  </div>
