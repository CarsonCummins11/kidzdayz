<div class="post_text">We visited USC and Occidental on Monday and Pomona and Claremont McKenna on Tuesday.  First off, how could any kid not want to go to college in Southern California?!?  End of January and it's 70 degrees and sunny EVERY day!  USC has a stunningly beautiful campus in downtown LA.  We both loved it and thought it was fabulous.  That is until we went to Claremont.  Occidental was definitely not for Lucy.  Pomona and Claremont McKenna on the other hand were both spectacular!!  We had such a fantastic time :)</div>
