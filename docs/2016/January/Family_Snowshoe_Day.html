<div class="post_text">Another fun day in the snow!  We went snowshoeing with the whole family minus Andy and Carson who were off on what was apparently a fabulous trail run at Silver Falls State Park.  We walked to Trillium Lake with everyone and had a great time, followed by dinner out where we hooked back up with Andy and Carson.  A very fun day all the way around!</div>
