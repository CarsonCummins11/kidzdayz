<div class="post_text">Andy and Carson were supposed to do a team duathlon on Sunday where Carson did two runs and Andy did the bike in between.  Well, the broken rib on Friday put a damper on that plan so, instead, Andy decided to do the full triathlon on his own.  Carson went as moral support and to take pictures for me.  Pretty nice of them as they had to leave the house at 6:45am :)  Andy wasn't overly excited about his time but given that he didn't anticipate doing it and, hence, didn't train, I'd say it was impressive that he even did it!  Carson loved it and is super excited to start doing them himself!</div>
