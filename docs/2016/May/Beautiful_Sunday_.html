<div class="post_text">Lucy has a lot going on at the moment!  She has 3 of her 4 AP tests this week so had to be at school this afternoon for a study session and this morning did her regular volunteer job at the hospital where she works with "medically fragile children".  We decided since we couldn't leave town to do something fun to enjoy the beautiful weather, we'd enjoy it in town.  We dropped Lucy off at the hospital this morning then the rest of us went to Washington Park for a fantastic run.  Carson went on his own and for the first time ever didn't get lost!  After that we picked Lucy up and all had lunch downtown and took a walk on the waterfront before Lucy had to head to school.  Fantastic way to spend the day :)</div>
