<div class="post_text">The stress and activity level at our house has been very high this fall!  Last night for the first time in a long time both kids were home after school and didn't need to be rushed off somewhere or to go straight to work.  We went out for a lovely walk with Carson on his unicycle, made homemade pizzas and then watched TV together.  It was very enjoyable and much-needed!</div>
