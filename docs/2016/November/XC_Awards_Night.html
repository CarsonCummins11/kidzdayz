<div class="post_text">The cross country awards night was a blast!  Carson got a varsity letter with the coach saying Carson was "the kind of runner coaches get really excited about" :).  Sorry to see a spectacular season come to an end.  Especially sad to see some of the seniors leaving.  Happy they'll still be around for winter training and track season!</div>
