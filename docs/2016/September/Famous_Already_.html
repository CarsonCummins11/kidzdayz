<div class="post_text">Carson got interviewed for the school's Humans of Sunset page.  I was a bit bummed about his quote but then he assured me he was off to practice in a rush when they took his picture.  He asked if he could give the quote after practice.  The guy was in a rush and asked if he could just make something up for Carson.  Carson said sure and now sounds like a stoner/surfer dude :)</div>
