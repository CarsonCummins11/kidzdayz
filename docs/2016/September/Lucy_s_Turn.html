<div class="post_text">I missed Lucy's meet last week because it was at the exact same time as Carson's first league meet.  Good news is she had a second meet on Saturday.  It was the crazy meet at the beach which has them running through mud pits, up massive hills and through long stretches of sand.  It was a gray and rainy day but such a fun race to watch!  Lucy had a fabulous race and a great time.  A very nice way to spend a day with her :)</div>
