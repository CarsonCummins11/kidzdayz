<div class="post_text">As our summer comes to a close we finally made a trip to the beach!  We decided to go to Pacific City for something different.  We all love the giant dune and the stunning views from the top of the dune.  We were thrilled to see two whales swimming together!  That was a first for all of us.  We hiked up and around the dune, walked on the beach and played in the water.  It could not have been a better day :)  I guess school can start now :(</div>
