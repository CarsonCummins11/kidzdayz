<div class="post_text">Lucy flew directly from Cancun to Richmond, VA for a "scholars weekend" at the University of Richmond.  It was for the kids who had been offered their big scholarships to come and visit the school and check things out.  Lucy absolutely fell in love with the school!!  We're thinking that's the direction she's headed but she's going down to Claremont McKenna next week for another interview for a scholarship down there so we'll see...  Hopefully she's nearing a decision!  What a process!!!</div>
