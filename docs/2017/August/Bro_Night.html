<div class="post_text">Carson's cross country team has "bro-night" a few times a month.  I love the tradition!  Carson finally decided to host.  We had 17 high school boys here for swimming, nerf gun wars, pizza and video games.  They were all very polite and nothing got broken or ruined so we call it a success!  I didn't want to mess with Carson's cool-factor by going out and asking them to pose for a picture so I decided to sneak a picture from the upstairs window... not creepy at all! :)</div>
