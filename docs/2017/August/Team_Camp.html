<div class="post_text">We are expecting record high temperatures all week this week.  Perfect time for Carson to go to his team's cross country running camp where they'll sleep in cabins with no AC anywhere in sight...  He was super excited to go and not at all concerned about the heat.  I went and bought him a battery powered fan.  We'll see how it goes.</div>
