<div class="post_text">Probably Carson's favorite thing is running, but a very close second is programming.  I decided to capture him in the midst of a big project.  The computer pieces in the foreground is a server he bought himself and took apart and reconstructed to do what he needed it to do.  He loves this stuff!</div>
