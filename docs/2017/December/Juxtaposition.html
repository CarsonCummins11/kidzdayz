<div class="post_text">Our winter vacation was pre-paid and there was no cancelling so we made the tough decision for Andy and Lucy to go without us.  They were able to recruit my nephew Ale to join them :)  Today I woke up to pictures of the adventurers all ready for the day of snowmobiling in Yellowstone.  They're having a great time.  Then I got Carson to come down for breakfast (first time he's been downstairs in 3 days) and he practically fell asleep at the table.  We went to the doctor and he was diagnosed with mono.  Waiting on the blood test.  We're seriously hoping this is actually the flu so he'll recover quicker!!  That said we're on day 7 now and he's still having a rough time... ugh...</div>
