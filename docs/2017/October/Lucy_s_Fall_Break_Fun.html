<div class="post_text">It's Lucy's fall break and she didn't have any big plans but luckily her roommate's lovely mom came down to visit and took Lucy and all their friends on some fun adventures.Â  She's had a great time enjoying some downtime and some Richmond adventures and I was thrilled Emily's mom sent some pictures :)</div>
