<div class="post_text">On Thursday we drove to Golden, CO just outside Denver to visit Colorado School of Mines for Carson.  It felt like a pretty good fit for him despite the fact that he wanted nothing to do with me taking pictures!  It's pretty much entirely an engineering school.  The only problem for him is that the CS department is pretty up and coming... we'll see.</div>
