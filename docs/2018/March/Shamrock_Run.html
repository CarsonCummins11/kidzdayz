<div class="post_text">Another year, another Shamrock Run.  Carson decided not to participate this year as he's trying to do only his coaches prescribed runs for track season but he insisted on going down to support Andy.  I was a little less enthusiastic about the early morning but a chance to spend the morning with Carson pulled me out of bed.  It was a huge turnout once again and Andy had a great race!  Carson wound up finding a friend and dropping me for a time but otherwise a lovely morning all the way around :)</div>
