<div class="post_text">A big weekend for Carson!  State yesterday and 17th birthday today.  Mostly he did homework all day but we did have a nice birthday breakfast and dinner, gifts, and a special breakfast guest :)  I was a little sad that we didn't make a bigger fuss for his birthday but we did what he wanted.  Love this kid so much!!</div>
