<div class="post_text">Andy and I went to NY for a wedding and left Carson home alone for 4 days.  He's very lucky to have his wonderful second family, Liz, David and Weston!  They had him over for dinner and Carson and Weston really hit it off :)  So grateful for them and this beautiful little boy!!</div>
