<div class="post_text">When Lucy left middle school she swore she'd never do another science fair!  For good reason!  Then I got this picture.  They had a symposium of sorts where they were asked to demonstrate the work they've been doing in a lab at school.  I really don't know much about what she does other than she works with zebra fish and it's something about the spinal cord.  Also, you ALWAYS have to remember to close the door! :-)</div>
