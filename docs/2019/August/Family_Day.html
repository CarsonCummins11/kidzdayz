<div class="post_text">Lucy got home at 1am Sunday morning and Carson had to leave for XC Team Camp on Monday at 11am so we had one full day together as a family.  We had breakfast together at home, went for a long hike in Forest Park, swimming at home, a cook out and game night.  So fantastic to have the day together :) :) :)</div>
