<div class="post_text">We went and did Carson's senior pictures last night. I can't believe it's time for this already :( We had his XC coach take the photos.  She donates her fee to the team's big fundraiser for Shriners Children's Hospital. She's one of Carson's very favorite people and it was a lot of fun hanging out with her last night!  Can't wait to see the pictures she took - these are a few I snapped</div>
