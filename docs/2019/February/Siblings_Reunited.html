<div class="post_text">Carson flew to Richmond to visit Lucy for President's Day weekend.  He was so excited to go!  They had a great time.  Lots of eating out, studying, working out, and trying out college classes.  He got to meet all of Lucy's friends and is SERIOUSLY ready to start college!!  Only bummer was the airline mix-up keeping him there an extra day... Oh yeah, that and the wallet he thought he lost so he flew without ID giving him an opportunity to have a long chat with several concerned TSA agents.  Good experience for a kid who wants to travel the world :)</div>
