<div class="post_text">Despite his injury flare-up which cost him 3 weeks of training and racing, Carson made it to Varsity Districts. He ran the 3000. He came in 7th which was slightly disappointing to him but given the interruption in training and the very tough competition, was really remarkable!Â  Timing was also on our side and Lucy was home to see his race :) Overall a really great junior year season for Carson!</div>
