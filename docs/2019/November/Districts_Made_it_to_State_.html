<div class="post_text">Carson raced in the District Finals on Wednesday. It was a beautiful day and he and his team had a really good race! They finished second (as expected) and Carson was recognized as second team all district for his 14th place finish in the district :) So proud of him and so sad it's coming to an end. It has been truly so much fun to watch him progress and grow as a runner! Will sorely miss these days!</div>
