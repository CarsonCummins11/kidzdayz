<div class="post_text">Carson had the day off school on Wednesday so Andy took the day off for them to go hiking. Given all the snow we've gotten recently the only option was heading west toward the beach.Â  I was sad to miss out but was home having a root canal :P Sounds like it was a great hike, especially given how late in the season it is!</div>
