<div class="post_text">I have always loved our Trader Joe's.  I love the food options, the low prices, and most of all the great staff who are always happy and make my day just a little bit brighter :).  So during this crazy time we're in, I just had to post this picture.  They currently have staff out front keeping us entertained while we wait in line.  This just made me so very happy!!</div>
