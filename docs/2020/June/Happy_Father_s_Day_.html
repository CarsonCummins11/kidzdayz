<div class="post_text">We had a bit of a disjointed Father's Day this year.Â  Lucy's not home and Carson had to work and then run 16 miles after work so he was barely around. Andy had a long bike ride and we got pizza for him for dinner and at about 10, after Carson's run we did gifts. I think Andy would call it a success :)</div>
