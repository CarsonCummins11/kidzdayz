<div class="post_text">I told Lucy about Carson and Elena were participating in a BLM march organized by students at Carson's high school. I told her I was proud of them. She chose that point to let me know that she and Jack have been going out every night. They also wrote a post for the student group at UR they've been part of since freshman year. It's called SEEDS (Students Engaging (in and) Enacting (a) Dialogue (on) Service)  They are now in leadership roles and worked with their peers to write the post below.  Very proud of her :)</div>
