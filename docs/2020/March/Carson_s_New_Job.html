<div class="post_text">Carson has been applying for jobs since last summer.  What do you know... he finally got an interview and a job just as school (and life in general) was closing down.  He's been working 35+ hours/week at Office Depot for several weeks now and is happy to be "getting paid to be bored instead of just doing it at home"</div>
