<h1 class="post_title">Alaska - Final Summer Hurrah</h1>

<div class="post_text">Our summer flew by without a real family trip :( So, we decided to take advantage of the week between Carson ending his job and heading back to school. We took a trip up to Alaska, and had several major adventures and a generally lovely time! We flew into Anchorage and spent a majority of the time based in a ski resort town called Girdwood. We had a crazy river rafting trip that was WAY outside my comfort zone (Class 5 rapids are much bigger in Alaska!!), spent a day hiking on a massive glacier and exploring lakes and crevasses, lots of hiking and a day kayaking in the Kenai Fjords National Park. Andy & I were super grateful to have the time with Carson, but it definitely wasn't the same without Lucy. Â Getting used to the new normal :)</div>
