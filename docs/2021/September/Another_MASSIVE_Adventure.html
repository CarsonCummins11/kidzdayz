<div class="post_text">Carson and two of his running buddies went for an adventure in the Adirondacks that turned out to be much more than they'd anticipated. They camped overnight at a trailhead. They got up at 3:30am and took off around 4 for what was supposed to be a 23 mile hike. They wound up hiking 34 miles, summiting 8 of the major peaks in the Adirondacks totaling more than 12,000 feet of elevation. They did not get back until nearly 10pm. He's not at the stage yet where he can say it was a fun adventure. He mostly says it was just miserable! The views look pretty fantastic to me, but I'm REALLY glad I wasn't part of the "fun"!</div>
