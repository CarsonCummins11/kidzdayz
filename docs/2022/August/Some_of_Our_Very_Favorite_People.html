<div class="post_text">While I'm very sad that some of our favorite people have moved away from Portland, I'm so so so so so so happy that Liz, David and their fabulous kids have moved to South Carolina, just 2 hours away from Lucy! They were hoping to come to Lucy's White Coat Ceremony but the slightly early arrival of new baby Brooks foiled that plan :) Good thing he's so amazingly adorable! Thrilled that we were able to go see them and that they're so close to Lucy now. <3</div>
