<div class="post_text">To get into Yosemite National Park during peak season you have to get a permit in advance which isn't super easy to do. But, if you get there before 6am you can go in without a permit. So, Carson and his roommate got up at 2am and drove to Yosemite for a day of hiking. Carson did a hike across from Half Dome called Clouds Rest which apparently has even better views than Half Dome. Well, the fog and rain made for a dramatically altered view. Such a bummer that he did such a challenging hike (on top of driving forever on no sleep) with no view for a reward. But, he says it was still a spectacular hike and he's really glad he did it :)</div>
